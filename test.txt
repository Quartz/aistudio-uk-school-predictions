Summary of key findings for parents and pupils 

 

This is an outstanding school.  

 Excellent leadership and strong teamwork 
from all staff ensure that much teaching is 
outstanding and never less than good. 

 Since the previous inspection, the 
headteacher has successfully focused on 
taking teaching to the highest level. 

 Achievement is outstanding throughout the 
school. Pupils of all levels of ability make 
excellent progress in reading, writing and 
mathematics. 

 Teachers keep a watchful eye on everyone’s 
progress, and give all pupils challenging 
work, but written feedback to pupils on their 
work is not always fully effective. 

 Pupils’ attitudes to learning are exemplary 
because the pupils find it inspiring. Pupils 
behave in a way that is both very courteous 
and respectful. 

 

 Pupils feel safe and are very well looked after 
by adults within school. Every effort is made to 
support pupils who may be experiencing 
difficulties.  

 The school provides memorable learning 
opportunities, and pupils benefit from an 
exciting and varied curriculum. Their 
enjoyment of the learning provided is reflected 
in their high rates of attendance. 

 Educational visits, visitors, sporting and 
musical opportunities successfully enhance the 
curriculum. 

 The strong links with the local church 
contribute very well to pupils’ social and moral 
development.  

 The governing body presents a high degree of 
challenge for senior leaders to continue to 
ensure teaching and achievement are of the 
highest quality.

Information about this inspection 

 This inspection was carried out with one day’s notice. Inspectors observed 12 lessons delivered 
by 12 teachers. All of the lessons were observed jointly with the headteacher or the deputy 
headteacher. 

 During this inspection, inspectors asked additional questions designed to ascertain the school’s 
view of the impact and effectiveness of local authority services to support school improvement. 
This information will contribute to work being carried out by Ofsted to assess the use, quality 
and impact of those services. 

 Inspectors observed pupils’ behaviour in lessons, around the school and during play. They 
looked at a selection of pupils’ written work and mathematics work from all year groups and 
listened to pupils of different abilities from Year 3 read. 

 Meetings were held with a group of pupils, including pupils who represented the school council. 

 The inspectors met with the headteacher and the deputy headteacher, and leaders responsible 
for English, mathematics and special educational needs. The lead inspector held separate 
meetings with a group of governors and a representative from the local authority. 

 The inspection took account of 58 responses to the online questionnaire (Parent View) that were 
submitted during the course of the inspection. An inspector spoke to parents attending a class 
assembly and the team took account of feedback from 13 staff questionnaires. 

 The inspectors observed the school’s work and examined a range of documentation, including 
the school’s own records of pupils’ learning and progress, the checks made on the quality of 
teaching and performance of staff and those relating to behaviour, attendance, child protection 
and safeguarding.

Full report 

Information about this school 

 Backwell Junior School is an average-sized primary school. The school belongs to a federation 
with West Leigh Infants School and shares the same headteacher and deputy headteacher. 
There is one governing body for the two schools. West Leigh Infants School is subject to a 
separate inspection and was not part of this inspection. 

 The proportion of pupils known to be eligible for pupil premium funding is well below that found 
nationally. The pupil premium is additional funding for those pupils who are known to be eligible 
for free school meals, those from service families and those that are looked after by the local 
authority. There are no children currently in the school who are being looked after by the local 
authority. 

 The proportion of disabled pupils and those who have special educational needs supported 
through school action is below that found nationally. The proportion of pupils supported at 
school action plus or with a statement of special educational needs is also below the national 
figure. The pupils’ needs relate mainly to moderate learning difficulties and behaviour difficulties. 

 Most pupils are of White British heritage. 

 The school meets the government’s current floor standards which set the minimum expectations 
for pupils’ attainment and progress. 

 Pupils start the school in September after their seventh birthday. Pupils are taught in single-aged 
classes with two classes in each of the year groups.  

 

What does the school need to do to improve further? 

 Further refine teachers’ written feedback to pupils when responding to pupils’ work by: 

 support for pupils to improve presentation and basic errors such as missing capital letters, 
punctuation and poorly joined handwriting  

 marking mathematics to give pupils sufficient challenge to improve their work and apply what 
they have learnt to a new challenge or more complex problem 

 marking in literacy and written work in other subjects which encourages pupils to act on 
advice and gives them time to do so.

Inspection judgements 

The achievement of pupils is outstanding 

 Pupils start school with attainment that is above the national average. During their time in school 
pupils, including the most able pupils, maintain very high standards in their work. This means 
that the levels of attainment, as reflected in the National Curriculum test results at the end of 
Key Stage 2, are high. Currently, school assessment information shows that well over half of all 
pupils are reaching standards well above those usually found for their age groups. 

 In lessons, pupils make excellent progress in writing, as a result of measures put in place to 
inspire pupils to write. In Year 3, pupils considered the features of writing a letter of complaint 
about ‘toenails present in a pizza’. The subject matter meant that there was a high level of 
engagement and ‘wow’ moments of ‘disgust’ which inspired pupils to put pen to paper. 

 There is a significant change to the progress pupils make in mathematics from the previous year. 
Currently, approximately two in every three pupils are now making more-than-expected 
progress, as a result of changes made to teaching. There is a sharper focus on challenging all 
abilities to achieve highly. This means that the proportion of pupils achieving the higher levels in 
mathematics has risen impressively in Years 4, 5 and 6.   

 Those pupils in receipt of pupil premium funding receive extra help in English and mathematics. 
The most recent National Curriculum test results at the end of Key Stage 2 show that this small 
group of pupils did particularly better in reading than similar pupils nationally. The scores for 
eligible pupils were higher in both subjects than the scores for other pupils in the school, 
showing the impact of the extra help on closing the gap in achievement.  

 Disabled pupils and those who have special educational needs make impressive progress in 
reading, writing and mathematics and outperform similar pupils nationally. Support is carefully 
tailored to meet their learning needs and builds their understanding effectively. Parents rightly 
express the view that their children who receive extra help are doing very well. 

 Pupils read widely and talk with confidence about their favourite authors. Younger pupils of 
different abilities use a variety of strategies to work out unfamiliar words in the text. Some use 
their phonic skills (the sounds made by letters) to sound out and build up words; others break 
more complex words, such as ‘flamboyantly’, down into recognisable syllables in order to make 
sense of the new and challenging vocabulary. 

 

The quality of teaching is outstanding 

 Pupils have the benefit of teaching that is, at least, never less than good, and usually 
outstanding. This has had a significant impact on their progress in writing, and more recently 
their impressive progress in mathematics. All the teaching that inspectors observed was, without 
exception, exciting, interesting and engaging.  

 A key strength in the teaching is the way it challenges pupils, including the more able, to gain 
knowledge and skills. All abilities learn successfully. In Year 6 mathematics, the pupils achieved 
very well at their different ability levels. Pupils aspired to work at their highest level and to 
change class if necessary to help them do so.  

 Homework is used for learning in different subjects. For example, in Year 4, pupils used 
homework as a basis for writing an explanation of what Anglo-Saxon houses were like from the 
models that they had made at home. The pride with which the pupils displayed their models 
helped to contribute to their learning, and meant that they were fully engrossed in their work. 

 Relationships in lessons are exceptionally positive. The strong emphasis given to encouraging 
pupils to make contributions during lessons is very effective. Consequently, pupils are very 
articulate and explain their ideas well. 

 Teachers create very positive atmospheres for learning. In Year 3 religious education, pupils 
discussed moral and spiritual issues from the perspective of the Islamic religion. The teacher 
created the mood for learning through Islamic music playing softly in the background. The 



Inspection report:  Backwell Church of England Junior School, 19–20 March 2014 5 of 10 

 

 

written work which resulted from this lesson, in the form of pupils’ personal prayers, was of a 
high quality. 

 Teachers’ subject expertise is excellent, as is their use of assessment to judge how well pupils 
are progressing. Consequently, teachers know exactly the precise steps which will move the 
pupils on to the next level. In a literacy lesson for Year 4, the teacher’s verbal advice about 
targets, with suggestions and reminders, moved pupils’ learning seamlessly from one level to the 
next.  

 Skilled teaching assistants provide support to ensure that those who find learning more difficult 
enjoy their learning and achieve well. Teachers’ and teaching assistants’ flexible approach results 
in this group of pupils making more-than-expected progress and achieving exceptionally in 
reading, writing and mathematics. 

 Pupils receive regular comments in their books from teachers when work is marked. These are 
often positive, such as ‘good work’ or ‘well done’. Teachers give pupils advice as to how to 
improve their work and further steps to take in learning. However, this is not always as effective 
as it could be. Some marking fails to pick up weaknesses in pupils’ presentation of their work, 
and basic errors, such as omitted capital letters and poorly joined handwriting. At times, the 
marking in mathematics does not give pupils sufficient challenge to improve their work or apply 
their knowledge. 

 

The behaviour and safety of pupils are outstanding 

 Inspectors endorsed the views of parents and staff, that the behaviour of pupils is outstanding. 
Pupils are invariably interested and curious about learning. Year 3 pupils responded very well to 
their teacher’s skill in enlivening learning and remained enthralled by the experience. Teachers’ 
management of behaviour is excellent. 

 Pupils are very polite and respectful. Behaviour is excellent when entering and leaving 
assemblies. Parents comment on how respectful pupils are to each other when performing in 
front of an adult audience during class assemblies with visitors present.  

 The school’s work to keep pupils safe and secure is outstanding. The overwhelming majority of 
parents who spoke with inspectors or who responded to Parent View were positive about the 
care their children receive, so that they are happy and safe in school. Pupils are confident that 
bullying is rare and that should they seek help from adults if necessary; any concerns are 
resolved quickly. Pupils’ enjoyment of school is reflected well in their high levels of attendance.  

 A very small minority of parents expressed the view that behavioural concerns were not dealt 
with quickly enough. Inspectors scrutinised behaviour records and actions taken by the school. 
They talked to pupils and observed pupils at work and at play. They found no evidence to 
suggest that the school was anything but extremely vigilant about behaviour, with consistently 
high expectations that all pupils should behave exceptionally well at all times. 

 Pupils’ leadership gives them a sense of responsibility. Play leaders look after others during 
playtimes and take their roles very seriously. The school council organises activities to raise 
money for charity, such as through Sport Relief. 

 The school has good systems for supporting those pupils whose circumstances may make them 
vulnerable. Links with external agencies enable pupils to receive the specialist support they 
need. In-school and after-school activities, made available through the primary sports funding, 
develop pupils’ confidence, sense of teamwork and fitness.  

 

The leadership and management are outstanding 

 The headteacher, very ably supported by the deputy headteacher, is leading the school with an 
impressively steadfast determination to ensure that teaching is always of the highest quality, 
that pupils receive memorable experiences and are very well prepared to move to the next stage 
in their education. Since the previous inspection, he has maintained the focus on pupils’ 
behaviour so that exemplary behaviour is the norm. All areas identified at the previous 



Inspection report:  Backwell Church of England Junior School, 19–20 March 2014 6 of 10 

 

 

inspection have been addressed, with pupils’ progress and attainment in writing being 
particularly impressive. 

 The targets set for teachers link the impact of teaching to the pupils’ achievement and are well 
used to keep expectations high. Leaders make sure everyone has an equal chance to do well. 
They have prudently planned this year’s additional funds, provided through extra government 
money (pupil premium) to provide learning mentors for individual pupils and extra teaching 
assistant support, over and above that normally provided. Consequently, gaps between the 
achievements of pupils known to be eligible for the pupil premium and other learners have 
narrowed successfully. 

 Leadership at all levels is very effective. The subject leader for mathematics has a sharp 
understanding of the areas for development in his subject. He quickly recognised the reasons 
why a number of pupils narrowly missed out on achieving higher levels in mathematics last year 
and has put actions in place to redress this. As a result, internal school tracking data show a 
very strong picture of progress in mathematics in Years 4, 5 and 6, with approximately two in 
every three pupils making better than expected progress by moving rapidly to reach the higher 
levels. 

 The school works well with parents. The quality of the work produced through homework tasks, 
particularly practical tasks such as model making, is testament to how well parents support their 
children’s learning. Parents like the range of activities that the school offers through different 
topics and clubs. Pupils have the opportunity to learn to play a musical instrument and young 
musicians demonstrate their developing skill to wider audiences during assemblies. 

 The primary sports funding is well used to provide a range of sports. The leadership team keeps 
a close eye on the quality of sports teaching delivered by outside coaches, as well as talent 
spotting any pupils who excel in order to develop their potential further.  

 Pupils are provided with opportunities to visit places of cultural and historic interest which 
support their learning further. The strong links with the local church provide many opportunities, 
including holiday opportunities, for pupils to develop their understanding of social, moral, 
spiritual and cultural aspects of learning. There is an effective balance between the strong 
academic curriculum and other aspects of learning, ensuring that the school is well placed to 
deliver the changes to the National Curriculum 2014. 

 Arrangements for safeguarding pupils meet statutory requirements. Discrimination of any kind is 
not tolerated.  

 The local authority has provided good support and challenge. This is achieved through 
challenging conversations with the headteacher, deputy headteacher and, on many occasions, a 
representative from the governing body. For example, there has been close comparison of 
pupils’ progress in mathematics in school with national expectations. Recent challenge from the 
local authority ensured that the school reflected on why some pupils missed out on achieving the 
higher levels in mathematics and a clear understanding of what needed to change.  

 A key strength in the local authority’s work has also been to challenge the school on the way 
self-evaluation documents are written. The headteacher reports that this has been particularly 
helpful in ensuring that self-evaluation is reflective and states what is working well and why, 
what not so well and what action needs to be taken. Governors endorse this improved practice. 

 Governors report that training delivered by the local authority, such as a recent governor 
conference, has been excellent because speakers are ‘inspirational’ in enabling them to improve 
their practice. Where the governing body has needed advice on staffing, this has been timely, 
appropriate, highly professional and supportive. Over time, the school considers support from 
the local authority has been more effective in the last few years because the same local 
authority representative has been working with the school, leading to a greater impact on school 
improvement. 

 The governance of the school: 

 Governors have a very sharp understanding of what goes on in school and the standards 
pupils achieve, including the difference pupil premium funding is making to eligible learners. 
They are strongly committed to see the school develop even further, through the recent 
federation with West Leigh Infants School. They ensure that their statutory duties are met, for

example in the systems to safeguard and protect pupils. The recent appointment of a business 
manager to oversee both schools has been a prudent decision and means that any issues 
relating to finance or safety are quickly addressed. Governors are very confident in challenging 
and holding school leaders to account for providing the very best education. They assiduously 
check the information they receive on the quality of teaching and the achievement and 
progress pupils make, through questions to senior leaders, headteacher’s reports, joining 
discussions with the local authority and visiting the school to see it at work. This approach 
gives governors a very good understanding of how teachers, including the headteacher, are 
held to account for their performance, and why the very best teachers are being rewarded 
through salary progression.

What inspection judgements mean 

School 

Grade Judgement Description 

Grade 1 Outstanding An outstanding school is highly effective in delivering outcomes 
that provide exceptionally well for all its pupils’ needs. This ensures 
that pupils are very well equipped for the next stage of their 
education, training or employment. 

Grade 2 Good A good school is effective in delivering outcomes that provide well 
for all its pupils’ needs. Pupils are well prepared for the next stage 
of their education, training or employment. 

Grade 3 Requires 
improvement 

A school that requires improvement is not yet a good school, but it 
is not inadequate. This school will receive a full inspection within 
24 months from the date of this inspection. 

Grade 4 Inadequate A school that has serious weaknesses is inadequate overall and 
requires significant improvement but leadership and management 
are judged to be Grade 3 or better. This school will receive regular 
monitoring by Ofsted inspectors. 

A school that requires special measures is one where the school is 
failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education and 
the school’s leaders, managers or governors have not 
demonstrated that they have the capacity to secure the necessary 
improvement in the school. This school will receive regular 
monitoring by Ofsted inspectors.
