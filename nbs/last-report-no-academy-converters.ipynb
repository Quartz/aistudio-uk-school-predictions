    "# Predicting School Closures Based on Inspection Reports with Deep Learning\n",
    "We scraped school inspection reports from [Ofsted](https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk) in an attempt to predict whether or not a school is in danger of closing. In this notebook, we take a deep learning approach to a Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem. This notebook applies [fast.ai's transfer learning](https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/) approach by training a language model (we'll get into what that is soon) on a large corpus of school reports. This model is then used to help our classifier predict whether or not a report contains some indication that the school will close.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic behind our approach was to separate all of the final reports of schools that have already closed. The idea behind this was that these reports may contain some information as to why the school would close. We labeled these reports `last`, while all other reports were labeled `not_last`."

    "## About the Dataset\n",
    "We filtered out some of the reports we scraped that had certain characteristics that we thought were not relevant to the problem we were trying to solve. Here are some of the reports we didn't include in our dataset: \n",
    "- Childminders: daycares in an individual's home who can care for up to six children at a time, including their own. Childminders are not necessarily academic institutions, so we have filtered them out.\n",
    "- Academy Converters: under the [Academies Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academies_Act_2010), schools had the option to become academies, which gave them more independence from the control of local authority. Since these schools technically did not close, but may have changed their names, we have not included the final reports of academy predecessors. We actually did train a model that originally included this set of reports, but the model ended up classifying several outstanding reports as `last` reports because many high performing schools decided to convert into academies. These reports actually were not a sign of closure, but rather that a high performing school had decided to switch to academy status.\n",
    "- Children's homes\n",
    "- Nurseries\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is important to note that [Ofsted does not continue to inspect schools once they are known for being Outstanding](https://www.bbc.com/news/education-48635078). Our data does not account for whether an Outstanding school has deteriorated in quality after its last inspection."

    "Our dataset has a pretty uneven class distribution, and only about 14 percent of our dataset has the `last` label. This poses a bit of a problem later on when we want to evaluate how well our classifier is doing. Accuracy is usually a common metric to evaluate a model, but it's not the best way to evaluate a model trained on an imbalanced dataset. For example, in our case, if the classifier were to guess that 100 percent of the samples we give it are `not_last`, it would have a pretty decent accuracy of 86 percent. However, this classifier would be doing pretty poorly in reality. \n",

This took about 3 days to train and the databunch we used was about 3GB large. We've provided a sample language model databunch in `nbs/data_lm.pkl` that was trained on a smaller subset of reports and is only about 33MB large. \n",

    "A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words that tries to predict what the next word of a sentence or phrase would be. For a more in-depth overview as to how language models work, you can refer to [these slides](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/languagemodeling.pdf) from Stanford University's Computer Science department.\n",

    "## Creating our Learner\n",
    "The Learner is what we'll use to train our model, which is in this case is [`AWD_LSTM`](https://docs.fast.ai/text.models.html#AWD_LSTM). AWD_LSTM is a type of RNN, or Recurrent Neural Network, that is available through fast.ai. \n",

    "### What's a neural network?\n",
    "Before giving an overview about RNNs, we're going to take a step back and go over what a neural network is. Loosely inspired by neurons in the human brain, neural networks consist of nodes, which on a very high level take in a set of inputs and modify them to produce an output. These inputs are modified by weights or coefficients that either amplify or dampen the input, depending on how important the information is relative to what the algorithm is trying to learn. After the products of the inputs and weights are found, these products are summed and passed through an activation function, which helps decide what the output should be. There are several types of activation functions, and you generally need to remember that they are some sort of mathematical equation. We won't dive into the math here, but you can refer to [this guide to get a sense of the activation functions that are out there](https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-neural-networks-1cbd9f8d91d6). In the context of a classification problem, the activation function of a node can help decide which class the sample we inserted belongs to. The inputs, in this case, would be a vector that represents the sentence of interest in mathematical form. There are several methods to vectorize text, but on a high level, this step is essentially converting words into a mathematical representation so that they can be multiplied by the weights each node. A neural network consists of several rows of neurons, where the input of one layer is the output of the previous layer. This is a *very* high level explanation, and there are several aspects of neural networks that we have not covered. To learn more about neural nets, you can refer to [this resource published by Skymind](https://skymind.com/wiki/neural-network) and this [free online book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) that takes a more hands-on approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a basic overview of what a neural network is, an RNN is a type of neural network that remembers its past decisions, and the decisions it makes are influenced by what it has learned from the past. RNNs are influenced not just by the weights applied to inputs, but also by a \"hidden\" state vector that provides context about prior inputs and outputs. Because they account for past decisions, RNNs are commonly used in Natural Language Processing, or NLP, because they can recall patterns of words that it previously learned. There are several types of RNNs, and the one we use here is a Long SHort-Term Memory Unit, or LSTM. To learn more, you can refer to [this resource published by Skymind.](https://skymind.com/wiki/lstm)\n",

    "### How do I get started using a neural network?\n",
    "In the context of fast.ai's text library, you just need to note that the model you are using is an RNN called the AWD_LSTM. You can get started using this algorithm the same way we do in the cell below by including it as a parameter for our learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I choose the type of learner I need?\n",
    "Since this is a text classification problem, we can go ahead and use fast.ai's [`text_classifier_learner`](https://docs.fast.ai/text.learner.html#text_classifier_learner) method to get started quickly. The type of learner you choose depends on the problem you are working with. For example, in `nbs/data_lm.py`, we used a [`language_model_learner`](https://docs.fast.ai/text.learner.html#language_model_learner) to create an RNN that would be able to recognize patterns of phrasing in our corpus. With our text_classifier_learner, we want an RNN that would be able to associate certain reports and phrasings with a given class. In this case, our classes are `last` and `not_last`."

    "### What's dropout?\n",
    "Dropout is a regularization technique that addresses *overfitting*. Dropout entails temporarily ignoring randomly selected nodes during training. This helps because it prevents nodes from becoming dependent on each other during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What's overfitting?\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when the model is fitting the training data too well and is learning things that are not generalizable. In other words, what it is learning is specific to the training data. Another type of statistical fit is underfitting. Underfitting occurs when a model can neither model the training data nor make a generalizable model. A model is overfitting when its training loss is significantly *lower* than its validation loss. Conversely, a model is underfitting when its training loss is significantly *greater* than its validation loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I adjust for overfitting or underfitting?\n",
    "If you're overfitting, you can adjust the dropout by increasing the `drop_mult` parameter of your learner. If you're underfitting, you can decrease this parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also adjust the weight decay (`wd`) of your model. Models with more parameters tend to overfit and have a high variance. By increasing weight decay, we penalize complexity by encouraging our model to have less parameters. In fast.ai, `wd = 0.1` generally works well, and the default is `wd = 0.01`."

    "## Choosing a Learning Rate\n",
    "A unique feature of fast.ai is that we can choose the learning rate at which our model trains. This helps us fine tune our model based on what seems to yield the highest accuracy. You typically want to choose a learning rate that is approximately in the middle of the steepest downward slope. If you need some help choosing a learning rate, you can always use `classifier.recorder.plot(suggestion=True)`."

    "## Checking the Precision of Our Model\n",
    "As we said before, our dataset is imbalanced, so accuracy is not a good measure of our model's effectiveness. Precision refers to how close predictions from different samples are to each other. Below, we use `average_precision_score` from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html). A single precision score is evaluated as `tp / (tp + fp)` where `tp` stands for *true positives* and `fp` stands for *false positives*. Average precision summarizes a precision-recall curve as the weighted mean of precisions achieved at each threshold. The increase in recall from the previous threshold is used as a weight. Recall measures the model's ability to find all relevant results that are correctly classified by your algorithm. Recall is the ratio `tp / (tp + fn)` where `tp` stands for *true positives* and `fn` stands for *false negatives*."

The visit was  fst short  carried out since   was judged to be  in July 2013.  This  continues to be .  The leadership team has maintained   quality of education in   since  last . You have successfully managed a period of considerable change in ing and ernance over  last few years and have developed a team that is committed to collectively taking responsibility for improving ’ outcomes. Staff are taking greater ownership of  professional development and are motivated to support  improvement in  areas of responsibility, many of which are new to m.   You are passionate about providing  with a wide range of opportunities to support  development as confident individuals who develop interests and enjoy . The rich and diverse curriculum is responsive to current events and successfully aims to include something to interest everybody. Extra-curricular activities such as atre skills, percussion, gardening, cookery and sports, enrich ’ experiences furr. You have also ensured that re is a calm and purposeful  envonment where ’ achievements are celebrated and y are insped to make a positive contribution. Pupils respond admably and are polite and well-mannered. They thoroughly embrace  opportunity to take on board responsibilities in . For example, some  run  own clubs, such as chess and colouring club, for ors to attend. Pupils’ enjoyment and interest in   contribute strongly to  pride y take in   and  consistently high attendance.    At  last , you were tasked with improving  quality of teaching and            . Despite a period of ing changes, you have secured  and improving teaching. Consequently, outcomes are improving in almost every subject and key stage. The proportion of  reaching a  level of development by  end of  s has been consistently above  national average and is improving. Attainment in reading, writing and mamatics at  end of key stage 1 has been at least in line with or better than  national average in 2016 and 2017. Likewise, by  end of key stage 2, progress and attainment have also been positive in reading and mamatics. However, you are acutely aware that ’ progress in writing by  end of key stage 2 in 2017 was below average. This resulted in attainment which was also below  national average. Writing was identified as an area for development at  last  and, while re have been some improvements in ’ outcomes, you acknowledge that re is more to do to ensure consistently strong progress for .    Safeguarding is effective.  You have created a vigilant culture of safeguarding throughout  . You have ensured that all safeguarding arrangements are fit for purpose and records are detailed and of high quality. Staff are well trained and knowledgeable about how to keep  safe. They are effective in recognising and responding to signs of concern.     Pupils said that y feel very safe in  and that  look after m well. They trust that  will deal with any issues of poor behaviour, fmly and faly, through  behaviour system. Records show that leaders and teachers respond with urgency to  very rare incidents of poor behaviour and bullying. The curriculum effectively develops ’ understanding of potential dangers such as crossing roads, bullying and using  internet. As a result,  know how to keep mselves and ors safe.    Inspection findings  \\uf06e Governors, many of whom are new to  roles, are keen and committed to making sure that y have  range of necessary skills to carry out  roles as effectively as possible. They have an accurate understanding of  ’s strengths and areas for development through  visits to  and reports from  headteacher and local authority. They also hear from teachers at regular standards meetings about  progress  are making throughout  . Governors are committed to  training and development of new  and leaders so that  quality of teaching and  continues to improve. Additionally, ernors have instigated  ’s conversion to become an academy to secure a greater capacity for furr improvement.   \\uf06e Leaders have accurately prioritised areas for improvement in  ’s development plan. However, you are keen to sharpen  success criteria so y are more precise and measurable and related to ’ outcomes when possible. You recognise that this will increase accountability and support leaders in checking  effect of improvement actions.  \\uf06e You have been keen to develop new  and leaders. A wide range of  have            made effective use of  links with  local cluster of , local authority training and a curriculum innovation group to support  continual development of teaching and . A particular success has been  development of teaching assistants who are now carrying out more varied roles and making a greater contribution to improving ’ outcomes. As a result of  feedback  receive and  training and development,  feel well supported and valued.  \\uf06e Phonics teaching has been an area of development in recent years as  proportion of  who met  standard in  Year 1 phonics screening check had been below  national average. Staff recognise  improvement in  subject knowledge and subsequent teaching of phonics as a result of training y have received. More regular assessment and incisive analysis by  subject leader also make sure that work is well matched to ’ needs and supports m in making much faster progress. Consequently, all  met  standard in  Year 1 phonics screening check in 2017.    \\uf06e Reading was identified as a strength at  ’s previous  and it continues to be so. You make sure that all  have high expectations of ’ reading and prioritise dedicated time to reading each day. Pupils are encouraged to read regularly at home. High-quality class texts and reading competitions maintain  high profile of reading throughout . Pupils who need to catch up with  reading are listened to on a more regular basis, and volunteers provide additional capacity for hearing  read. Pupils develop a love of reading and, consequently,  ’s assessment information shows that current  are making  progress in all year groups. The proportion of  reaching and exceeding  expected standard at  end of key stages 1 and 2 in 2017 was well above  national average.  \\uf06e Pupils’ outcomes in writing have historically not been as strong as in reading and mamatics. Writing attainment at key stage 1 in 2017 was in line with  national average at  expected standard, and above it for  reaching a greater depth of understanding. However, by  end of key stage 2 in 2017, attainment and progress in writing were below  national average. Leaders have prioritised  development of ’ writing and are seeing some improvements. You are aware, however, of  need to increase  proportion of  who reach and exceed  expected standard, particularly by  end of key stage 2. Training, moderation and sharing of  practice have supported  development of teachers’ subject knowledge, awareness of curriculum expectations and accuracy of assessment. Pupils are now demonstrating greater writing stamina and motivation to write. However, you acknowledge that evidence from lessons and work in ’ books confm that re are some missed opportunities by teachers to pick up on mistakes made during lessons. At times, this results in  repeatedly making  same errors and not moving on with   quickly enough.                  Next steps for    Leaders and those responsible for ernance should ensure that:  \\uf06e ’ writing progress is accelerated so that an increasing proportion of  reach and exceed  expected standard by  end of key stage 2 \\uf06e   improvement plan contains more precise success criteria relating to specific outcomes for   \\uf06e teachers quickly pick up on ’ errors during lessons so that  make more rapid gains in  .
