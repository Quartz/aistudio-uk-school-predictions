pupils xxunk attitudes and behaviour in the classroom are very good xxunk xxmaj only infrequently is learning disrupted by episodes of difficult behaviour xxunk xxmaj this is because staff have very

reception classes and start to learn and make progress xxunk xxmaj activities offered to children encourage xxunk to develop strong social skills and to learn how to play xxunk xxunk xxmaj however xxunk there are not always enough planned activities to enable xxunk to make strong progress in early writing or in developing early number skills xxunk xxmaj this slower progress for some children was reflected in the dip in the number of children reaching the expected standard at the end of last year xxunk xxmaj current data shows that children are on track to reverse this trend by the end of this year xxunk xxmaj safeguarding is effective xxunk xxmaj the work of the highly effective deputy principal has ensured that safeguarding pupils is central to the school xxunk work xxunk xxmaj her

partnership with other professionals enables her to support pupils and their families xxunk often at times of crisis xxunk xxmaj you take pride in the fact that whole xxunk school attendance is above

safeguarding issue xxunk xxmaj with the help of the parent support adviser xxunk the deputy principal identifies the key concerns for each family xxunk xxmaj support offered takes a variety of forms xxunk from purchasing alarm clocks xxunk to offering to help xxunk xxunk xxunk xxunk to bringing pupils to school in the morning until parents are able to take over the role xxunk xxunk xxmaj this often very practical support increases xxunk attendance and supports the well xxunk being of families xxunk xxmaj governors and staff at all levels undertake regular safeguarding training xxunk xxmaj as a result xxunk procedures in school to keep pupils safe and secure are strong xxunk xxmaj this is appreciated by parents who feel that school not only keeps their children safe in school xxunk but also teaches xxunk how to keep xxunk safe crossing the road xxunk riding a bike and when using the internet xxunk xxmaj inspection findings xxunk xxmaj children who join the school xxunk xxmaj reception class come from a large number of xxunk school settings xxunk xxmaj while staff visit a number of different settings xxunk they do not always manage to develop effective links with all of xxunk xxunk xxmaj sometimes this affects the quality of data collected by school and slows the assessment of children xxunk abilities when entering school xxunk xxunk xxmaj children settle well into the early years xxunk xxmaj they quickly develop a range of skills such as how to take turns when playing xxunk xxunk xxmaj their development of more academic skills xxunk such as writing and mathematics xxunk sometimes takes longer because opportunities to practise these skills are not always planned as frequently as they should be xxunk xxmaj this slows the progress for some children xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils in key stage xxunk make good and often better progress in reading xxunk writing and mathematics xxunk xxmaj results in last xxunk national phonics check for pupils in xxmaj

the quality of teaching is inadequate xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching in xxmaj key xxmaj stages xxunk and xxunk has been inadequate for some time xxunk xxmaj this is especially noticeable in

however xxunk there are examples of better teaching xxunk xxmaj in a xxmaj year 5 literacy lesson xxunk for example xxunk pupils were working independently on a range of tasks carefully matched to their ability xxunk developing an information booklet for younger children on how china clay is produced xxunk xxmaj the teacher checked on pupils well and encouraged xxunk to move onto the next stage as soon as they had completed what they were doing xxunk xxmaj consequently xxunk progress in this lesson was good xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not have high enough expectations for what the pupils should be able to achieve and lessons are often slow xxunk xxmaj in a xxmaj year 6 mathematics lesson xxunk pupils spent too much time cutting out and making three xxunk dimensional shapes xxunk such as cylinders xxunk which did not help xxunk to work out the surface area using a formula xxunk xxunk xxmaj in too many lessons in xxmaj key xxmaj stages xxunk and xxunk xxunk pupils are taught xxunk

xxunk xxmaj dear xxmaj mrs xxmaj xxunk xxmaj short inspection of xxmaj reid xxmaj street xxmaj primary xxmaj school xxmaj following my visit to the school on xxunk xxmaj january xxunk xxunk i write on behalf of xxmaj her xxmaj majesty xxunk xxmaj chief xxmaj inspector of xxmaj education xxunk xxmaj children xxunk xxmaj services and xxmaj skills to report the inspection findings xxunk xxmaj the visit was the first short inspection carried out since the school was judged to be good in xxmaj may xxunk xxunk xxmaj this school continues to be good xxunk xxmaj the leadership team has maintained the good quality of education in the school since the last inspection xxunk xxmaj since your appointment just over a year ago xxunk you have focused on improving the good foundations that you inherited within the school xxunk xxmaj your passion xxunk coupled with determination and a very good understanding of the school xxunk has helped you to bring about further improvement at a fast pace xxunk xxmaj you have built a strong leadership team who share your vision for the future of the school xxunk xxmaj staff also share your determination to make the school even better xxunk xxmaj pupils continue to make good progress across the school in both mathematics and xxmaj english xxunk xxmaj your forensic approach to analysing school data has enabled you to recognise the progress of individual pupils and different groups xxunk xxmaj you have recently carried out a detailed audit of how the school spends the funding it receives for disadvantaged pupils xxunk xxmaj this has enabled you to clearly identify the barriers these pupils face both inside and outside school and target support for xxunk more accurately xxunk xxmaj current data shows that differences between their progress and that of other pupils nationally are diminishing in most year groups across the school xxunk xxmaj since the previous inspection xxunk you have worked hard and successfully to improve the quality of teaching of mathematics across the school xxunk xxmaj the results of xxunk attainment in the national tests last year clearly evidence the success of your strategies as results in mathematics rose across both key stages xxunk and xxunk xxunk xxmaj the creative curriculum in school gives pupils opportunities to learn in a variety of xxunk different ways xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk pupils in xxmaj year 4 recently re xxunk enacted the battle of xxmaj bosworth in the school hall xxunk xxmaj this xxunk coupled with visits to a wide variety of different locations xxunk including the seaside and a local castle xxunk has given pupils a range of new experiences which have in turn improved their writing skills xxunk xxmaj the curriculum is not only very well planned xxunk but also it offers pupils a rich and wide selection of opportunities to participate in sport xxunk xxmaj the work of the physical education coordinator and the recently employed sports apprentice has led to an increase in the number of sports offered to pupils xxunk xxmaj these include dodge ball xxunk football xxunk boccia xxunk basketball and swimming xxunk xxmaj the array of trophies on display in the school entrance is clear evidence of the strength of xxunk sporting prowess xxunk despite the lack of facilities other than the hall and the school playground xxunk xxmaj pupils who have special educational needs and xxunk or disabilities make equally good progress to xxunk xxunk xxmaj your recognition that a significant number of pupils who attend school have speech and language problems has enabled you to develop effective bespoke support for these pupils xxunk xxmaj the teaching assistant who delivers this support has undertaken extra training xxunk which has allowed her to make a difference to more than one hundred pupils within school xxunk xxmaj her very close working partnership with the speech and language therapy team has further increased the effectiveness of this work xxunk which benefits pupils across the school xxunk xxmaj you are rightly proud of xxunk behaviour across the school xxunk xxmaj despite the difficulties faced by many pupils xxunk attitudes and behaviour in the classroom are very good xxunk xxmaj only infrequently is learning disrupted by episodes of difficult behaviour xxunk xxmaj this is because staff have very high expectations and are consistent in their use of the school xxunk behaviour management strategies xxunk xxmaj children who join the xxmaj reception class often come from a wide variety of pre xxunk school provision xxunk xxmaj they arrive with a wide range of skills and knowledge xxunk often below what is typical for their age xxunk xxmaj they soon settle into the routines of the xxmaj reception classes and start to learn and make progress xxunk xxmaj activities offered to children encourage xxunk to develop strong social skills and to learn how to play xxunk xxunk xxmaj however xxunk there are not always enough planned activities to enable xxunk to make strong progress in early writing or in developing early number skills xxunk xxmaj this slower progress for some children was reflected in the dip in the number of children reaching the expected standard at the end of last year xxunk xxmaj current data shows that children are on track to reverse this trend by the end of this year xxunk xxmaj safeguarding is effective xxunk xxmaj the work of the highly effective deputy principal has ensured that safeguarding pupils is central to the school xxunk work xxunk xxmaj her meticulous and methodical approach to recording all incidents electronically enables her to monitor and respond effectively to safeguarding concerns xxunk xxmaj her vigilant approach and close working partnership with other professionals enables her to support pupils and their families xxunk often at times of crisis xxunk xxmaj you take pride in the fact that whole xxunk school attendance is above that of other xxunk similar schools xxunk xxmaj however xxunk the attendance of some pupils is not as good as it could be xxunk xxmaj the deputy principal rightly regards this as a potential safeguarding issue xxunk xxmaj with the help of the parent support adviser xxunk the deputy principal identifies the key concerns for each family xxunk xxmaj support offered takes a variety of forms xxunk from purchasing alarm clocks xxunk to offering to help xxunk xxunk xxunk xxunk to bringing pupils to school in the morning until parents are able to take over the role xxunk xxunk xxmaj this often very practical support increases xxunk attendance and supports the well xxunk being of families xxunk xxmaj governors and staff at all levels undertake regular safeguarding training xxunk xxmaj as a result xxunk procedures in school to keep pupils safe and secure are strong xxunk xxmaj this is appreciated by parents who feel that school not only keeps their children safe in school xxunk but also teaches xxunk how to keep xxunk safe crossing the road xxunk riding a bike and when using the internet xxunk xxmaj inspection findings xxunk xxmaj children who join the school xxunk xxmaj reception class come from a large number of xxunk school settings xxunk xxmaj while staff visit a number of different settings xxunk they do not always manage to develop effective links with all of xxunk xxunk xxmaj sometimes this affects the quality of data collected by school and slows the assessment of children xxunk abilities when entering school xxunk xxunk xxmaj children settle well into the early years xxunk xxmaj they quickly develop a range of skills such as how to take turns when playing xxunk xxunk xxmaj their development of more academic skills xxunk such as writing and mathematics xxunk sometimes takes longer because opportunities to practise these skills are not always planned as frequently as they should be xxunk xxmaj this slows the progress for some children xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils in key stage xxunk make good and often better progress in reading xxunk writing and mathematics xxunk xxmaj results in last xxunk national phonics check for pupils in xxmaj year xxunk were above those nationally xxunk xxmaj current data shows that your xxmaj year xxunk pupils are on course for similarly pleasing results this year xxunk xxunk xxmaj key stage xxunk pupils also make good and better progress over time across the curriculum xxunk xxmaj leaders and governors have ensured that recommendations to improve the quality of teaching and learning in mathematics have been fulfilled xxunk and this improvement is evidenced in the improved attainment of xxmaj year 6 pupils in mathematics last year xxunk xxunk xxmaj the progress of disadvantaged pupils last year dipped xxunk xxmaj however xxunk school data shows most are now on course to make good and better progress in both xxmaj english and mathematics xxunk xxmaj next steps for the school xxmaj leaders and those responsible for governance should ensure that xxunk xxunk close monitoring is carried out on the provision and outcomes in the early years foundation stage in order to ensure that as many children as are able reach the early learning goals xxunk 4 i am copying this letter to the xxunk of the governing body xxunk the regional schools commissioner and the xxunk of children xxunk services

data that compare how well pupils moved on in xxmaj english and mathematics since xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk show the school is among the lowest performing schools nationally in this respect xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils in xxmaj key xxmaj stages xxunk and xxunk spend too much time doing sums xxunk xxmaj not enough time is spent on getting xxunk to use their skills in addition xxunk subtraction xxunk multiplication and division to solve problems xxunk xxmaj as a result xxunk pupils do not build up their understanding xxunk xxmaj despite the amount of time doing sums xxunk pupils often make basic errors that are not pointed out by the teachers and therefore pupils assume their answers are correct xxunk xxunk xxmaj xxunk mathematical skills do not develop in a systematic way as the pupils move through the school xxunk xxmaj much of the work they are given at all stages is suitable for those who are much younger xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk pupils in xxmaj year 6 were sorting a small number of simple two xxunk dimensional shapes by comparing their properties xxunk such as angles and number of sides xxunk an activity more appropriate to xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk and far too undemanding for xxmaj year 6 xxunk xxunk xxmaj xxunk writing skills do not develop well because they are not expected to write longer pieces of text xxunk xxmaj teachers do not plan the topic work so that it includes opportunities to develop xxunk writing skills further they often ignore mistakes in spelling xxunk punctuation and grammar xxunk xxmaj work can contain many xxunk often careless xxunk mistakes xxunk such as the xxmaj year xxunk pupil xxunk work on the rainforest where several spellings of xxunk xxunk were ignored and marked as xxunk good xxunk xxunk xxmaj xxunk books show that there is very little attention paid to using a consistent style of handwriting xxunk xxmaj much of the writing is untidy xxunk and any incorrectly formed letters and numbers are not checked and corrected xxunk xxunk xxmaj the introduction of a scheme xxunk at the start of this academic year xxunk to support the teaching of phonics xxunk linking letters to their sounds xxunk is having a positive effect on raising xxunk achievement in reading xxunk xxmaj however xxunk reading attainment at the end of xxmaj year 6 is still below the national average xxunk xxunk xxmaj some disabled

however xxunk too many make inadequate progress and a substantial proportion do not make any progress at all xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils who are entitled to support through the pupil premium make similar progress to that of all other pupils xxunk xxmaj in the xxunk tests at the end of xxmaj year 6 their average point score in xxmaj english showed they were attaining similarly to other pupils xxunk but in mathematics they were almost a year behind xxunk xxunk xxmaj when children join the school in the xxmaj nursery xxunk their levels of skill and knowledge are below what would normally be expected for their age xxunk xxmaj good quality teaching and interesting learning activities help all children to make good progress within the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching is inadequate xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching in xxmaj key xxmaj stages xxunk and xxunk has been inadequate for some time xxunk xxmaj this is especially noticeable in mathematics and has led to inadequate achievement xxunk xxunk xxmaj the xxunk planning of mathematics lessons does not meet xxunk needs xxunk based on their ability and taking into account what they have already learnt to do xxunk xxmaj the work set is often too easy and does not extend or challenge pupils xxunk including the more able xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk the xxunk use of incorrect use of mathematical vocabulary limits xxunk understanding xxunk xxunk xxmaj the problem is compounded because some pupils have gaps in understanding that need to be filled by going back over earlier work xxunk xxmaj however xxunk teachers do not give pupils the right kind of work to remedy this xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk in a xxmaj year 4 lesson xxunk pupils were required to add and subtract xxmaj inspection report xxunk xxmaj st xxmaj dennis xxmaj community xxmaj primary xxmaj school xxunk xxunk xxmaj april xxunk 6 of xxunk three xxunk digit numbers from xxunk three xxunk digit number xxunk pupils in xxmaj year xxunk are expected to do this xxunk and it was therefore too easy for some xxunk xxmaj yet many other pupils needed help because they had not developed the necessary skills earlier xxunk xxunk xxmaj in lessons teachers do not check xxunk progress and pupils are not moved on quickly enough to more challenging work that they could undertake independently xxunk xxmaj however xxunk there are examples of better teaching xxunk xxmaj in a xxmaj year 5 literacy lesson xxunk for example xxunk pupils were working independently on a range of tasks carefully matched to their ability xxunk developing an information booklet for younger children on how china clay is produced xxunk xxmaj the teacher checked on pupils well and encouraged xxunk to move onto the next stage as soon as they had completed what they were doing xxunk xxmaj consequently xxunk progress in this lesson was good xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not have high enough expectations for what the pupils should be able to achieve and lessons are often slow xxunk xxmaj in a xxmaj year 6 mathematics lesson xxunk pupils spent too much time cutting out and making three xxunk dimensional shapes xxunk such as cylinders xxunk which did not help xxunk to work out the surface area using a formula xxunk xxunk xxmaj in too many lessons in xxmaj key xxmaj stages xxunk and xxunk xxunk pupils are taught xxunk by the teacher as a whole group for too long and some pupils quickly lose interest xxunk xxmaj it is especially the case when the work is repeating previously learnt work xxunk as in a xxmaj year xxunk storytelling session xxunk xxmaj here the teacher xxunk reading a book about the rainforest xxunk asked questions pupils could easily answer and subsequently a small group of boys paid little attention and made no contribution xxunk xxunk xxmaj the recent introduction of the regular teaching of phonics has improved the progress in reading made by most disabled pupils or those with special educational needs xxunk xxmaj however xxunk many of these pupils are taught in the classrooms under the supervision of teaching assistants xxunk who are not always effective in developing xxunk ability to think xxunk learn and work by xxunk xxunk xxmaj too often when they are working with groups of pupils they control the speed that the pupils complete their work xxunk and in some cases provide pupils with answers xxunk than supporting their learning xxunk xxunk xxmaj in the xxmaj nursery and xxmaj reception classes xxunk the teaching is good with well xxunk planned activities that encourage children to learn in all areas xxunk using both the inside and outdoor spaces xxunk xxmaj children are encouraged to use previously learnt skills xxunk as in the xxmaj nursery session where children counted up to eight and then used this in an activity writing numbers xxunk xxmaj the behaviour and safety of pupils xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj xxunk behaviour xxunk improvement because at xxmaj key xxmaj stages xxunk and xxunk xxunk too many pupils lack the ability to work independently and with sustained concentration xxunk especially in mathematics xxunk xxmaj this is usually when teaching lacks pace and challenge and where individual pupils are not being moved onto harder work quickly enough xxunk xxunk xxmaj where teaching is good xxunk pupils show they can concentrate and behaviour is much better xxunk xxmaj even where lessons do not engage their attention they remain respectful to adults xxunk xxmaj pupils behave well out of lessons and are very considerate of each other xxunk including in the playground xxunk demonstrating their understanding of what is right and wrong xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils feel safe in school xxunk xxmaj all parents who completed xxmaj parent xxmaj view or were spoken to by an inspector xxunk this xxunk xxmaj pupils had a clear understanding of the different types of bullying including physical xxunk verbal and cyber xxunk bullying xxunk xxmaj they were keen to say that the school was a safe place to be and they knew that adults at the school would quickly sort out any problems pupils might have xxunk xxunk xxmaj the behaviour of children in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage is good xxunk xxmaj they are happy xxunk feel secure and demonstrate good attitudes towards their learning xxunk xxmaj this results in especially good progress being made in their personal xxunk social and emotional development xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils are keen to take an active role school life and a range of sporting activities provides opportunities for xxunk to represent the school xxunk xxmaj the leadership and management are inadequate xxmaj inspection report xxunk xxmaj st xxmaj dennis xxmaj community xxmaj primary xxmaj school xxunk xxunk xxmaj april xxunk 7 of xxunk xxunk xxmaj leaders and managers xxunk including governors xxunk have not responded to data about xxunk achievement quickly enough to secure the necessary improvements xxunk xxmaj some of the issues raised in the school xxunk previous inspection report have been tackled but xxunk achievement and the quality of teaching have declined xxunk xxmaj this indicates that leadership and management are ineffective xxunk xxunk xxmaj leadership of the curriculum at xxmaj key xxmaj stages xxunk and xxunk xxunk especially in mathematics xxunk is inadequate because lessons do not meet all xxunk needs and lead to poor progress xxunk xxmaj this is particularly the case for the more able xxunk and for disabled pupils and those who have special educational needs xxunk xxunk xxmaj the headteacher has not managed the performance of teachers sufficiently well and so the necessary improvements in teaching have not happened xxunk xxmaj although some teachers on higher pay have not had further pay rises xxunk teachers are not held accountable for the achievement of the pupils they teach xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school xxunk self xxunk evaluation is inaccurate and does not reflect high enough expectations xxunk xxmaj the school improvement plan is not working as actions taken are not resulting in improvements in achievement and teaching xxunk xxunk xxmaj leaders xxunk with the exception of the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage leader xxunk do not demonstrate the skills necessary to question the results of their work and therefore this limits the school xxunk capacity to improve xxunk xxunk xxmaj while the school does not tolerate discrimination in any form xxunk it does not provide equality of opportunity for its pupils because too many underachieve xxunk xxmaj the funding received through the pupil premium is being used to target support xxunk for example on small group work for eligible pupils xxunk xxmaj however xxunk the school has not fully assessed xxunk this strategy is working xxunk xxunk xxmaj the local authority has provided the school with some light touch support as it was identified as not being at risk xxunk xxunk xxmaj although it was a limited response xxunk just under a quarter of parents who completed xxmaj parent xxmaj view disagreed that leadership and management are good xxunk xxmaj inspection findings support this view xxunk xxunk xxmaj the governance of the school xxunk xxmaj since the previous inspection xxunk the governors have not pushed the school xxunk leaders hard enough to improve xxunk achievement and the quality of teaching xxunk xxmaj although there have been some recent changes of personnel on the governing body xxunk much of the questioning of the school xxunk performance comes from the xxmaj xxunk xxunk xxmaj there is not enough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses at the school shared between governors so they are unable to hold the school

improve teaching so that it is consistently good or better by ensuring that xxunk there are more lessons that provide pupils with active xxunk practical tasks using a broader range of resources and more opportunities for pupils to take risks with their learning assessment information is used more effectively to plan tasks that are more precisely matched to the needs of learners of all abilities

not consistently make good progress from their starting points xxunk xxunk xxmaj children start at the school in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage with skills and knowledge that vary from year to year and are often below expectations for their age but are currently as expected for their age xxunk xxmaj children make expected progress in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj compared to the national picture xxunk overall attainment in xxunk was considerably below average for pupils at the end of xxmaj year xxunk xxunk and significantly so in writing as pupils do not build rapidly enough on the gains they make in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has successfully improved the progress pupils make in xxmaj year xxunk to xxmaj year 6 and as a result xxunk attainment at the end of xxmaj year 6 in xxunk was closer to average overall but lower in xxmaj english than in mathematics xxunk xxmaj fewer pupils than found nationally reach the higher xxmaj level xxunk at the end of xxmaj year xxunk or xxmaj level 5 at the end of xxmaj year 6 xxunk xxmaj the provision for disabled pupils and those with special educational needs ensures that they make similar progress to xxunk xxunk xxunk xxmaj in the xxunk tests xxunk the attainment of xxmaj year 6 pupils who benefited from the pupil premium was similar to that of other xxmaj year 6 pupils in the school and pupils nationally in xxmaj english xxunk xxmaj in mathematics their attainment was four months behind xxunk in the school but better than found nationally xxunk xxunk xxmaj in xxmaj english xxunk progress in writing has improved in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk because of the introduction of xxunk the writing xxunk which gives pupils more opportunities to write extended pieces of work xxunk develop spelling xxunk punctuation and grammar skills and write more extensively in different subjects xxunk xxmaj this approach has more recently been introduced in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk and has yet to have a similar impact on progress or attainment xxunk xxunk xxmaj in the xxunk xxmaj year xxunk phonics screening check xxunk linking sounds and letters xxunk taken by

xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage and xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk to include e books xxunk which motivate pupils at school and home xxunk xxmaj pupils have reasonable basic phonic skills to read unfamiliar words but some xxunk particularly less able readers xxunk are not reading confidently to make the text make sense xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has worked hard to promote reading for enjoyment across the school xxunk xxmaj older pupils can talk enthusiastically about favourite authors and express preferences for different types of books xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able readers are encouraged through various lunchtime book clubs and develop higher level reading skills such as inference and deduction to help with their comprehension skills xxunk xxunk xxmaj mathematics lessons start with a mental mathematics session to develop xxunk recall of number facts but these are sometimes too lengthy and not pitched at a fast enough pace to improve xxunk skills xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able pupils in xxmaj year 5 and xxmaj year 6 are often taught in a different group xxunk which is helping xxunk to make faster progress at an appropriate level xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj teaching xxunk improvement because the quality of teaching across the school is inconsistent and varies from good to inadequate xxunk xxmaj there is not yet enough good or better teaching to result in xxunk good achievement xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always have high enough expectations of what pupils can achieve xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching does not always make the best use of a range of resources to encourage pupils to be active in their learning or take risks by finding things out for xxunk xxunk xxmaj the pace of learning is not always fast enough especially when pupils have to listen for too long to xxunk xxmaj inspection report xxunk xxmaj victoria xxmaj road xxmaj primary xxmaj school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 5 of xxunk introductions before starting on their own work xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always use assessment information effectively and so the tasks set in lessons are not always matched precisely to the needs of pupils of different abilities xxunk xxmaj this means that sometimes there are not enough demands made on more xxunk able pupils and sometimes less able pupils struggle xxunk xxunk xxmaj xxunk work is marked regularly xxunk xxmaj there are some very good examples of marking that gives pupils clear pointers about how to improve their work but this is not at the same level of quality in all classes xxunk xxmaj there are some opportunities for self xxunk assessment by pupils but these are not always followed up by teachers xxunk xxunk xxmaj the stronger teaching xxunk however xxunk has started to make a positive impact on xxunk progress xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk xxmaj year 5 pupils made good progress in an xxmaj english lesson where they were learning to write and perform poetry because the lesson was well planned to meet the needs of all pupils and so they were all fully engaged and enthusiastic about their work xxunk xxmaj similarly xxunk teaching in a xxmaj year xxunk mathematics lesson where pupils learned about capacity through well planned practical activities xxunk ensured that they made good progress xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching assistants generally make a good contribution to xxunk learning through supporting individuals or small groups to fully participate in lessons xxunk xxmaj they are careful to support while promoting xxunk independence xxunk particularly disabled pupils and those with special educational needs xxunk xxmaj the behaviour and safety of pupils are good xxunk xxmaj behaviour is mostly good in lessons and when pupils are xxunk at playtimes xxunk lunchtimes and in assemblies xxunk xxunk xxmaj older pupils say that teachers manage behaviour well in lessons xxunk xxmaj inspectors agree with this except for a very few occasions where teaching does not fully engage pupils and the behaviour of a few pupils can slip as they become restless and inattentive xxunk which is why behaviour is not outstanding xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school is very inclusive and supports its pupils who find it difficult to manage their own behaviour very well xxunk xxmaj where needed xxunk they receive effective one xxunk to xxunk one support xxunk which minimises any disruption to other pupils in the class xxunk xxunk xxmaj on occasion xxunk staff do not make their expectations clear enough to pupils xxunk for example xxunk how they should line up at the end of playtime and lunchtime xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils have good attitudes to school and are kind and thoughtful towards each other xxunk xxmaj they enjoy the opportunities to work xxunk on tasks xxunk are supportive and helpful and appreciate xxunk successes xxunk xxmaj they enjoy the responsibilities they are given xxunk for example as house captains and buddies xxunk xxunk xxmaj most parents and carers agree that the school keeps their children safe and that they are well looked after xxunk xxmaj they are not so confident that their children behave well although the inspectors found that they do xxunk xxmaj scrutiny of behaviour records show this is the case over time too xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils say they feel very safe in school and understand how to keep safe in different situations xxunk xxmaj in discussion pupils say there is very little bullying in school and that they are confident that if any incidents occur xxunk teachers sort things out quickly and xxunk xxunk xxmaj they have a good awareness that bullying can take different forms such as name calling and physical xxunk prejudiced xxunk based and cyber bullying xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils enjoy coming to school as shown by their above average attendance and punctuality to school xxunk xxmaj inspection report xxunk xxmaj victoria xxmaj road xxmaj primary xxmaj school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 6 of xxunk xxmaj the leadership and management xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj leadership and management xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj although the school is steadily improving xxunk staff absences at senior leadership level have impeded the pace and full impact of the school xxunk work to raise achievement and improve teaching xxunk xxmaj however xxunk some improved teaching has resulted in better progress for the current year groups xxunk especially in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has improved teaching and achievement from inadequate at the previous inspection xxunk xxmaj this demonstrates its capacity to improve further xxunk although it has not yet produced consistently good teaching over time or good achievement overall xxunk xxunk xxmaj checks on xxunk performance by the headteacher and senior leaders are regular and more focused than previously on the quality of xxunk learning xxunk xxmaj where weaknesses are identified xxunk feedback is given to individuals and support is provided xxunk xxmaj however xxunk weaknesses are not always eradicated at a fast enough pace xxunk xxmaj the school recognises that more work needs to be done to ensure that learning and progress are consistently good or better to improve achievement xxunk xxunk xxmaj strong leadership in xxmaj english has helped to successfully secure broadly average standards by the end of xxmaj year 6 and most notably xxunk the better progress in writing xxunk which was an issue to improve in the previous inspection xxunk xxunk xxmaj xxunk progress is tracked efficiently xxunk xxmaj targets are set for teachers that are linked well with the progress pupils make and teachers know they are accountable for xxunk progress and that this is linked to pay and salary progression xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school xxunk understanding of its own effectiveness is accurate in some areas but a little too optimistic in xxunk xxunk xxmaj however xxunk there is a shared drive from a united team of staff to secure school improvement and staff express confidence in and share the ambition of the headteacher xxunk xxmaj action taken as a result of monitoring and evaluation does not always result in rapid enough improvement xxunk xxunk xxmaj the efficient management of provision for disabled pupils and those with special educational needs is a strength and is ensuring that these pupils make broadly similar and sometimes better progress compared with xxunk in the school xxunk xxunk xxmaj the subjects taught meet the interests of pupils well xxunk xxmaj there is an appropriate emphasis on developing

improve teaching so that it is consistently good or better by ensuring that xxunk there are more lessons that provide pupils with active xxunk practical tasks using a broader range of resources and more opportunities for pupils to take risks with their learning assessment information is used more effectively to plan tasks that are more precisely matched to the needs of learners of all abilities

not consistently make good progress from their starting points xxunk xxunk xxmaj children start at the school in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage with skills and knowledge that

xxunk xxmaj compared to the national picture xxunk overall attainment in xxunk was considerably below average for pupils at the end of xxmaj year xxunk xxunk and significantly so in writing as pupils do not build rapidly enough on the gains they make in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has successfully improved the progress pupils make in xxmaj year xxunk to xxmaj year 6 and as a result xxunk attainment at the end of xxmaj year 6 in xxunk was closer to average overall but lower in xxmaj english than in mathematics xxunk xxmaj fewer pupils than found nationally reach the higher xxmaj level xxunk at the end of xxmaj year xxunk or xxmaj level 5 at the end of xxmaj year 6 xxunk xxmaj the provision for disabled pupils and those with special educational needs ensures that they make similar progress to xxunk xxunk xxunk xxmaj in the xxunk tests xxunk the attainment of xxmaj year 6 pupils who benefited from the pupil premium was similar to that of other xxmaj year 6 pupils in the school and pupils nationally in xxmaj english xxunk xxmaj in mathematics their attainment was four months behind xxunk in the school but better than found nationally xxunk xxunk xxmaj in xxmaj english xxunk progress in writing has improved in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk because of the introduction of xxunk the writing xxunk which gives pupils more opportunities to write extended

the school xxunk xxmaj older pupils can talk enthusiastically about favourite authors and express preferences for different types of books xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able readers are encouraged through various lunchtime book clubs and develop higher level reading skills such as inference and deduction to help with their comprehension skills xxunk xxunk xxmaj mathematics lessons start with a mental mathematics session to develop xxunk recall of number facts but these are sometimes too lengthy and not pitched at a fast enough pace to improve xxunk skills xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able pupils in xxmaj year 5 and xxmaj year 6 are often taught in a different group xxunk which is helping xxunk to make faster progress at an appropriate level xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj teaching xxunk improvement because the quality of teaching across the school is inconsistent and varies from good to inadequate xxunk xxmaj there is not yet enough good or better teaching

listen for too long to xxunk xxmaj inspection report xxunk xxmaj victoria xxmaj road xxmaj primary xxmaj school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 5 of xxunk introductions before starting on their own work xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always use assessment information effectively and so the tasks set in lessons are not always matched precisely to the needs of pupils of different abilities xxunk xxmaj this means that sometimes there are not enough demands made on more xxunk able pupils and sometimes less able pupils struggle xxunk xxunk xxmaj xxunk work is marked regularly xxunk xxmaj there are some very good examples of marking that gives pupils clear pointers about how to improve their work but this is not at the same level of quality in all classes xxunk xxmaj there are some opportunities for self xxunk assessment by pupils but these are not always followed up by teachers xxunk xxunk xxmaj the stronger teaching xxunk however xxunk has started to make a positive impact on xxunk progress xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk xxmaj year 5 pupils made good progress in an xxmaj english lesson where they were learning to write and perform poetry because the lesson was well planned to meet the needs of all pupils and so they were all fully engaged and enthusiastic about their work xxunk xxmaj similarly xxunk teaching in a xxmaj year xxunk mathematics lesson where pupils learned about capacity through well planned practical activities xxunk ensured that they made good progress xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching assistants generally make a good contribution to xxunk learning through supporting individuals or small groups to fully participate in lessons xxunk xxmaj they are careful to support while promoting xxunk independence xxunk particularly disabled pupils and those with special educational needs xxunk xxmaj the behaviour and safety of pupils are good xxunk xxmaj behaviour is mostly good in lessons and when pupils are xxunk at playtimes xxunk lunchtimes and in assemblies xxunk xxunk xxmaj older pupils say that teachers manage behaviour well in lessons xxunk xxmaj inspectors agree with this except for a very few occasions where teaching does not fully engage pupils and the behaviour of a few pupils can slip as they become restless and inattentive xxunk which is why behaviour is not outstanding xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school is very inclusive and supports its pupils who find it difficult to manage their own behaviour very well xxunk xxmaj where needed xxunk they receive effective one xxunk to xxunk one support xxunk which minimises any disruption to other pupils in the class xxunk xxunk xxmaj on occasion xxunk staff do not make their expectations clear enough to pupils xxunk for example xxunk how they should line up at the end of playtime and lunchtime xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils have good attitudes to school and are kind and thoughtful towards each other xxunk xxmaj they enjoy the opportunities to work xxunk on tasks xxunk are supportive and helpful and appreciate xxunk successes xxunk xxmaj they enjoy the responsibilities they are given xxunk for example as house captains and buddies xxunk xxunk xxmaj most parents and carers agree that the school keeps their children safe and that they are well looked after xxunk xxmaj they are not so confident that their children behave well although the inspectors found that they do xxunk xxmaj scrutiny of behaviour records show this is the case over time too xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils say they feel very safe in school and understand how to keep safe in different situations xxunk xxmaj in discussion pupils say there is very little bullying in school and that they are confident that if any incidents occur xxunk teachers sort things out quickly and xxunk xxunk xxmaj they have a good awareness that bullying can take different forms such as name calling and physical xxunk prejudiced xxunk based and cyber bullying xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils enjoy coming to school as shown by their

capacity to improve further xxunk although it has not yet produced consistently good teaching over time or good achievement overall xxunk xxunk xxmaj checks on xxunk performance by the headteacher and senior leaders are regular and more focused than previously on the quality of xxunk learning xxunk xxmaj where weaknesses are identified xxunk feedback is given to individuals and support is provided xxunk xxmaj however xxunk weaknesses are not always eradicated at a fast enough pace xxunk xxmaj the school recognises that more work needs to be done to ensure that learning and progress are consistently good or better to improve achievement xxunk xxunk xxmaj strong leadership in xxmaj english has helped to successfully secure broadly average standards by the end of xxmaj year 6 and most notably xxunk the better progress in writing xxunk which was an issue to improve in the previous inspection xxunk xxunk xxmaj xxunk progress is tracked efficiently xxunk xxmaj targets are set for teachers that are linked well with the progress pupils make and teachers know they are accountable for xxunk progress and that this is linked to pay and salary progression xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school xxunk understanding of its own effectiveness is accurate in some areas but a little too optimistic in xxunk xxunk xxmaj however xxunk there is a shared drive from a united team of staff to secure school improvement and staff express confidence in and share the ambition of the headteacher xxunk xxmaj action taken as a result of monitoring and evaluation does not always result in rapid enough

was similar to that of other xxmaj year 6 pupils in the school and pupils nationally in xxmaj english xxunk xxmaj in mathematics their attainment was four months behind xxunk in the school but better than found nationally xxunk xxunk xxmaj in xxmaj english xxunk progress in writing has improved in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk because of the introduction of xxunk the writing journey xxunk which

reasonable basic phonic skills to read unfamiliar words but some xxunk particularly less able readers xxunk are not reading confidently to make the text make sense xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has worked hard to promote reading for enjoyment across the school xxunk xxmaj older pupils can talk enthusiastically about favourite authors and express preferences for different types of books xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able readers are encouraged through various lunchtime book clubs and develop higher level reading skills such as inference and deduction to help with their comprehension skills xxunk

school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 5 of xxunk introductions before starting on their own work xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always use assessment information effectively and so the tasks set in

xxunk xxmaj the stronger teaching xxunk however xxunk has started to make a positive impact on pupils xxunk progress xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk xxmaj year 5 pupils made good progress in an xxmaj english lesson where they were learning to write and perform poetry because the lesson was well planned to meet the needs of all pupils and so they were all fully engaged and enthusiastic about their

xxmaj where needed xxunk they receive effective one xxunk to xxunk one support xxunk which minimises any disruption to other pupils in the class xxunk xxunk xxmaj on occasion xxunk staff do not make

xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils say they feel very safe in school and understand how to keep safe in different situations xxunk xxmaj in discussion pupils say there is very little bullying in school and that

consequently pupils do not consistently make good progress from their starting points xxunk xxunk xxmaj children start at the school in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage with

reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj compared to the national picture xxunk overall attainment in xxunk was considerably below average for pupils at the end of xxmaj year xxunk xxunk and significantly so in writing as pupils do not build rapidly enough on the gains they make in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has successfully improved the progress pupils make in xxmaj year xxunk to xxmaj year 6 and as a result xxunk attainment at the end of xxmaj year 6 in xxunk was closer to average overall but lower in xxmaj english than in mathematics xxunk xxmaj fewer pupils than found nationally reach the higher xxmaj level xxunk at the end of xxmaj year xxunk or xxmaj level 5 at the end of xxmaj year 6 xxunk xxmaj the provision for disabled pupils and those with special educational needs ensures that they make similar progress to xxunk xxunk xxunk xxmaj in the xxunk tests xxunk the attainment of xxmaj year 6 pupils who benefited from the pupil premium was similar to that of other xxmaj year 6 pupils in the school and pupils nationally in xxmaj english xxunk xxmaj in mathematics their attainment was four months behind xxunk in the school but better than found nationally xxunk xxunk xxmaj in xxmaj english xxunk progress in writing has improved in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk because of the introduction of xxunk the writing journey xxunk which gives pupils more opportunities to write extended pieces of work xxunk develop spelling xxunk punctuation and grammar skills and write more extensively in different subjects xxunk xxmaj this approach

xxunk linking sounds and letters xxunk taken by pupils currently in xxmaj year xxunk xxunk the proportion of pupils achieving the expected result was below average xxunk xxmaj the school has extended phonics teaching in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage and xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk to include e books xxunk which motivate pupils at school and home xxunk xxmaj pupils have reasonable basic phonic skills to read unfamiliar words but some xxunk particularly less able readers xxunk are not reading confidently to make the text make sense xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has worked hard to promote reading for enjoyment across the school xxunk xxmaj older pupils can talk enthusiastically about favourite authors and express preferences for different types of books xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able readers are encouraged through various lunchtime book clubs and develop higher level reading skills such as inference and deduction to help with their comprehension skills xxunk xxunk xxmaj mathematics lessons start with a mental mathematics session to develop pupils xxunk recall of number facts but these are sometimes too lengthy and not pitched at a fast enough pace to improve pupils xxunk skills xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able pupils in xxmaj year 5 and xxmaj year 6 are often taught in a different group xxunk which is helping xxunk to make faster progress at an appropriate level xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj teaching xxunk improvement because the quality of teaching across the school is inconsistent and varies from good to inadequate xxunk xxmaj there is not yet enough good or better teaching to result in pupils xxunk good achievement xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always have high enough expectations of what pupils can achieve xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching does not always make the best use of a range of resources to encourage pupils to be active in their learning or take risks by finding things out for xxunk xxunk xxmaj the pace of learning is not always fast enough especially when pupils have to listen for too long to teachers xxunk xxmaj inspection report xxunk xxmaj victoria xxmaj road xxmaj primary xxmaj school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 5 of xxunk introductions before starting on their own work xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always use assessment information effectively and so the tasks set in lessons are not always matched precisely to the needs of pupils of different abilities xxunk xxmaj this means that sometimes there are not enough demands made on more xxunk able pupils and sometimes less able pupils struggle xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils xxunk work is marked regularly xxunk xxmaj there are some very good examples of marking that gives pupils clear pointers about how to improve their work but this is not at the same level of quality in all classes xxunk xxmaj there are some opportunities for self xxunk assessment by pupils but these are not always followed up by teachers xxunk xxunk xxmaj the stronger teaching xxunk however xxunk has started to make a positive impact on pupils xxunk progress xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk xxmaj year 5 pupils made good progress in an xxmaj english lesson where they were learning to write and perform poetry because the lesson was well planned to meet the needs of all pupils and so they were all fully engaged and enthusiastic about their work xxunk xxmaj similarly xxunk teaching in a xxmaj year xxunk mathematics lesson where pupils learned about capacity through well planned practical activities xxunk ensured that they made good progress xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching assistants generally make a good contribution to pupils xxunk learning through supporting individuals or small groups to fully participate in lessons xxunk xxmaj they are careful to support while promoting pupils xxunk independence xxunk particularly disabled pupils and those with special educational needs xxunk xxmaj the behaviour and safety of pupils are good xxunk xxmaj behaviour is mostly good in lessons and when pupils are xxunk at playtimes xxunk lunchtimes and in assemblies xxunk xxunk xxmaj older pupils say that teachers manage behaviour well in lessons xxunk xxmaj inspectors agree with this except for a very few occasions where teaching does not fully engage pupils and the behaviour of a few pupils can slip as they become restless and inattentive xxunk which is why behaviour is not outstanding xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school is very inclusive and supports its pupils who find it difficult to manage their own behaviour very well xxunk xxmaj where needed xxunk they receive effective one xxunk to xxunk one support xxunk which minimises any disruption to other pupils in the class xxunk xxunk xxmaj on occasion xxunk staff do not make their expectations clear enough to pupils xxunk for example xxunk how they should line up at the end of playtime and lunchtime xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils have good attitudes to school and are kind and thoughtful towards each other xxunk xxmaj they enjoy the opportunities to work xxunk on tasks xxunk are supportive and helpful and appreciate xxunk xxunk successes xxunk xxmaj they enjoy the responsibilities they are given xxunk for example as house captains and buddies xxunk xxunk xxmaj most parents and carers agree that the school keeps their children safe and that they are well looked after xxunk xxmaj they are not so confident that their children behave well although the inspectors found that they do xxunk xxmaj scrutiny of behaviour records show this is the case over time too xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils say they feel very safe in school and understand how to keep safe in different situations xxunk xxmaj in discussion pupils say there is very little bullying in school and that they are confident that if any incidents occur xxunk teachers sort things out quickly and xxunk xxunk xxmaj they have a good awareness that bullying can take different forms such as name calling and physical xxunk prejudiced xxunk based and cyber bullying xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils enjoy coming to school as shown by their above average attendance and punctuality to school xxunk xxmaj inspection

xxunk xxmaj improve teaching so that it is consistently good or better by ensuring that xxunk there are more lessons that provide pupils with active xxunk practical tasks using a broader range of resources and more opportunities for pupils to take risks with their learning assessment information is used more effectively to plan tasks that are more precisely matched to the needs of learners of

consequently pupils do not consistently make good progress from their starting points xxunk xxunk xxmaj children start at the school in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage with

reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj compared to the national picture xxunk overall attainment in xxunk was considerably below average for pupils at the end of xxmaj year xxunk xxunk and significantly so in writing as pupils do not build rapidly enough on the gains they make in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has successfully improved the progress pupils make in xxmaj year xxunk to xxmaj year 6 and as a result xxunk attainment at the end of xxmaj year 6 in xxunk was closer to average overall but lower in xxmaj english than in mathematics xxunk xxmaj fewer pupils than found nationally reach the higher xxmaj level xxunk at the end of xxmaj year xxunk or xxmaj level 5 at the end of xxmaj year 6 xxunk xxmaj the provision for disabled pupils and those

was similar to that of other xxmaj year 6 pupils in the school and pupils nationally in xxmaj english xxunk xxmaj in mathematics their attainment was four months behind xxunk in the school but better than found nationally xxunk xxunk xxmaj in xxmaj english xxunk progress in writing has improved in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk because of the introduction of xxunk the writing journey xxunk which

xxunk linking sounds and letters xxunk taken by pupils currently in xxmaj year xxunk xxunk the proportion of pupils achieving the expected result was below average xxunk xxmaj the school has extended

reasonable basic phonic skills to read unfamiliar words but some xxunk particularly less able readers xxunk are not reading confidently to make the text make sense xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has worked hard to promote reading for enjoyment across the school xxunk xxmaj older pupils can talk enthusiastically about favourite authors and express preferences for different types of books xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able readers are encouraged through various lunchtime book clubs and develop higher level reading skills such as inference and deduction to help with their comprehension skills xxunk xxunk xxmaj mathematics lessons start with a mental mathematics session to develop pupils xxunk recall of number facts but these are sometimes too lengthy and not pitched at a fast enough pace to improve pupils xxunk skills xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able pupils in xxmaj year 5 and xxmaj year 6 are often taught in a different group xxunk which is helping xxunk to make faster progress at an appropriate level xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj teaching xxunk improvement because the quality of teaching across the school is inconsistent and varies from good to

school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 5 of xxunk introductions before starting on their own work xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always use assessment information effectively and so the tasks set in

less able pupils struggle xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils xxunk work is marked regularly xxunk xxmaj there are some very good examples of marking that gives pupils clear pointers about how to improve their work but this is not at the same level of quality in all classes xxunk xxmaj there are some opportunities for self xxunk assessment by pupils but these are not always followed up by teachers xxunk xxunk xxmaj the stronger teaching xxunk however xxunk has started to make a positive impact on pupils xxunk progress xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk xxmaj year 5 pupils made good progress in an xxmaj english lesson where they were learning to write and perform poetry because the lesson was well planned to meet the needs of all pupils and so they were all fully engaged and enthusiastic about their work xxunk xxmaj similarly xxunk teaching in a xxmaj year xxunk mathematics lesson where pupils learned about capacity through well planned practical activities xxunk ensured that they made good progress xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching assistants generally make a good contribution to pupils xxunk learning through supporting individuals or small groups to fully participate in lessons xxunk xxmaj they are careful to support while promoting pupils xxunk independence xxunk particularly disabled pupils and those with special educational needs xxunk xxmaj the behaviour and safety of pupils are good xxunk xxmaj behaviour is mostly good in lessons and when pupils are xxunk at playtimes xxunk lunchtimes and in assemblies xxunk xxunk xxmaj older pupils say that teachers manage behaviour well in lessons xxunk xxmaj inspectors agree with this except for a very few occasions where teaching does not fully engage pupils and the behaviour of a few pupils can slip as they become restless and inattentive xxunk which is why behaviour is not outstanding xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school is very inclusive and supports its pupils who find it difficult to manage their own behaviour very well xxunk xxmaj where needed xxunk they receive effective one xxunk to xxunk one support xxunk which minimises any disruption to other pupils in the class xxunk xxunk xxmaj on occasion xxunk staff do not make

after xxunk xxmaj they are not so confident that their children behave well although the inspectors found that they do xxunk xxmaj scrutiny of behaviour records show this is the case over time too xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils say they feel very safe in school and understand how to keep safe in different situations xxunk xxmaj in discussion pupils say there is very little bullying in school and that they are confident that if any incidents occur xxunk teachers sort things out quickly and xxunk xxunk xxmaj they have a good awareness that bullying can take different forms such as name calling and
