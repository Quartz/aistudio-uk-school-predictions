    "# Predicting School Closures Based on Inspection Reports with Deep Learning\n",
    "We scraped school inspection reports from [Ofsted](https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk) in an attempt to predict whether or not a school is in danger of closing. In this notebook, we take a deep learning approach to a Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem. This notebook applies [fast.ai's transfer learning](https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/) approach by training a language model (we'll get into what that is soon) on a large corpus of school reports. This model is then used to help our classifier predict whether or not a report contains some indication that the school will close.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic behind our approach was to separate all of the final reports of schools that have already closed. The idea behind this was that these reports may contain some information as to why the school would close. We labeled these reports `last`, while all other reports were labeled `not_last`."

    "## About the Dataset\n",
    "We filtered out some of the reports we scraped that had certain characteristics that we thought were not relevant to the problem we were trying to solve. Here are some of the reports we didn't include in our dataset: \n",
    "- Childminders: daycares in an individual's home who can care for up to six children at a time, including their own. Childminders are not necessarily academic institutions, so we have filtered them out.\n",
    "- Nurseries\n",
    "- Children's homes\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is important to note that [Ofsted does not continue to inspect schools once they are known for being Outstanding](https://www.bbc.com/news/education-48635078). Our data does not account for whether an Outstanding school has deteriorated in quality after its last inspection."

    "## Imbalanced Dataset\n",
    "Our dataset has a pretty uneven class distribution, and only about 1/5 of our dataset has the `last` label. This poses a bit of a problem later on when we want to evaluate how well our classifier is doing. Accuracy is usually a common metric to evaluate a model, but it's not the best way to evaluate a model trained on an imbalanced dataset. For example, in our case, if the classifier were to guess that 100% of the samples we give it are `not_last`, it would have a pretty decent accuracy of 80%. However, this classifier would be doing pretty poorly in reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to measure the performance for an imbalanced dataset other than accuracy, and we'll look into our model's *precision* and *recall* later on to tell us how it's doing. We've included the `f_beta` metric For now, which evaluates an F1 score that takes the weighted average of precision and recall.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our problem, we decided to keep the dataset imbalanced to better reflect the distribution of reports in reality. Since the number of reports that aren't final reports greatly outweighs the number of final reports in our real-life problem, I wanted my classifier to reflect this situation."

    "## Creating our Learner\n",
    "The Learner is what we'll use to train our model, which is in this case is [`AWD_LSTM`](https://docs.fast.ai/text.models.html#AWD_LSTM). AWD_LSTM is a type of RNN, or Recurrent Neural Network, that is available through fast.ai. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What's a neural network?\n",
    "Before giving an overview about RNNs, we're going to take a step back and go over what a neural network is. Loosely inspired by neurons in the human brain, neural networks consist of nodes, which on a very high level take in a set of inputs and modify them to produce an output. These inputs are modified by weights or coefficients that either amplify or dampen the input, depending on how important the information is relative to what the algorithm is trying to learn. After the products of the inputs and weights are found, these products are summed and passed through an activation function, which helps decide what the output should be. There are several types of activation functions, and you generally need to remember that they are some sort of mathematical equation. We won't dive into the math here, but you can refer to [this guide to get a sense of the activation functions that are out there](https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-neural-networks-1cbd9f8d91d6). In the context of a classification problem, the activation function of a node can help decide which class the sample we inserted belongs to. The inputs, in this case, would be a vector that represents the sentence of interest in mathematical form. There are several methods to vectorize text, but on a high level, this step is essentially converting words into a mathematical representation so that they can be multiplied by the weights each node. A neural network consists of several rows of neurons, where the input of one layer is the output of the previous layer. This is a *very* high level explanation, and there are several aspects of neural networks that we have not covered. To learn more about neural nets, you can refer to [this resource published by Skymind](https://skymind.com/wiki/neural-network) and this [free online book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) that takes a more hands-on approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a basic overview of what a neural network is, an RNN is a type of neural network that remembers its past decisions, and the decisions it makes are influenced by what it has learned from the past. RNNs are influenced not just by the weights applied to inputs, but also by a \"hidden\" state vector that provides context about prior inputs and outputs. Because they account for past decisions, RNNs are commonly used in Natural Language Processing, or NLP, because they can recall patterns of words that it previously learned. There are several types of RNNs, and the one we use here is a Long SHort-Term Memory Unit, or LSTM. To learn more, you can refer to [this resource published by Skymind.](https://skymind.com/wiki/lstm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I get started using a neural network?\n",
    "In the context of fast.ai's text library, you just need to note that the model you are using is an RNN called the AWD_LSTM. You can get started using this algorithm the same way we do in the cell below by including it as a parameter for our learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I choose the type of learner I need?\n",
    "Since this is a text classification problem, we can go ahead and use fast.ai's [`text_classifier_learner`](https://docs.fast.ai/text.learner.html#text_classifier_learner) method to get started quickly. The type of learner you choose depends on the problem you are working with. For example, in `nbs/data_lm.py`, we used a [`language_model_learner`](https://docs.fast.ai/text.learner.html#language_model_learner) to create an RNN that would be able to recognize patterns of phrasing in our corpus. With our text_classifier_learner, we want an RNN that would be able to associate certain reports and phrasings with a given class. In this case, our classes are `last` and `not_last`."

    "Dropout is a regularization technique that addresses *overfitting*. Dropout entails temporarily ignoring randomly selected nodes during training. This helps because it prevents nodes from becoming dependent on each other during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What's overfitting?\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when the model is fitting the training data too well and is learning things that are not generalizable. In other words, what it is learning is specific to the training data. Another type of statistical fit is underfitting. Underfitting occurs when a model can neither model the training data nor make a generalizable model. A model is overfitting when its training loss is significantly *lower* than its validation loss. Conversely, a model is underfitting when its training loss is significantly *greater* than its validation loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I adjust for overfitting or underfitting?\n",
    "If you're overfitting, you can adjust the dropout by increasing the `drop_mult` parameter of your learner. If you're underfitting, you can decrease this parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also adjust the weight decay (`wd`) of your model. Models with more parameters tend to overfit and have a high variance. By increasing weight decay, we penalize complexity by encouraging our model to have less parameters. In fast.ai, `wd = 0.1` generally works well, and the default is `wd = 0.01`."

improve teaching so that it is consistently good or better by ensuring that xxunk there are more lessons that provide pupils with active xxunk practical tasks using a broader range of resources and more opportunities for pupils to take risks with their learning assessment information is used more effectively to plan tasks that are more precisely matched to the needs of learners of all abilities

not consistently make good progress from their starting points xxunk xxunk xxmaj children start at the school in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage with skills and knowledge that

xxunk xxmaj compared to the national picture xxunk overall attainment in xxunk was considerably below average for pupils at the end of xxmaj year xxunk xxunk and significantly so in writing as pupils do not build rapidly enough on the gains they make in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has successfully improved the progress pupils make in xxmaj year xxunk to xxmaj year 6 and as a result xxunk attainment at the end of xxmaj year 6 in xxunk was closer to average overall but lower in xxmaj english than in mathematics xxunk xxmaj fewer pupils than found nationally reach the higher xxmaj level xxunk at the end of xxmaj year xxunk or xxmaj level 5 at the end of xxmaj year 6 xxunk xxmaj the provision for disabled pupils and those with special educational needs ensures that they make similar progress to xxunk xxunk xxunk xxmaj in the xxunk tests xxunk the attainment of xxmaj year 6 pupils who benefited from the pupil premium was similar to that of other xxmaj year 6 pupils in the school and pupils nationally in xxmaj english xxunk xxmaj in mathematics their attainment was four months behind xxunk in the school but better than found nationally xxunk xxunk xxmaj in xxmaj english xxunk progress in writing has improved in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk because of the introduction of xxunk the writing xxunk which gives pupils more opportunities to write extended pieces of work xxunk develop spelling xxunk punctuation and grammar skills and write more extensively in different subjects xxunk xxmaj this approach has more recently been introduced in xxmaj key

xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage and xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk to include e books xxunk which motivate pupils at school and home xxunk xxmaj pupils have reasonable basic phonic skills to read unfamiliar words but some xxunk particularly less able readers xxunk are not reading confidently to make the text make sense xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has worked hard to promote reading for enjoyment across the school xxunk xxmaj older pupils can talk enthusiastically about favourite authors and express preferences for different types of books xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able readers are encouraged through various lunchtime book clubs and develop higher level reading skills such as inference and deduction to help with their comprehension skills xxunk xxunk xxmaj mathematics lessons start with a mental mathematics session to develop xxunk recall of number facts but these are sometimes too lengthy and not pitched at a fast enough pace to improve xxunk skills xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able pupils in xxmaj year 5 and xxmaj year 6 are often taught in a different group xxunk which is helping xxunk to make faster progress at an appropriate level xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj teaching xxunk improvement because the quality of teaching across the school is inconsistent and varies from good to inadequate xxunk xxmaj there is not yet enough good or better teaching to result in xxunk good achievement xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always have high enough expectations of what pupils can achieve xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching does not always make the best use of a range

listen for too long to xxunk xxmaj inspection report xxunk xxmaj victoria xxmaj road xxmaj primary xxmaj school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 5 of xxunk introductions before starting on their own work xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always use assessment information effectively and so the tasks set in lessons are not always matched precisely to the needs of pupils of different abilities xxunk xxmaj this means that sometimes there are not enough demands made on more xxunk able pupils and sometimes less able pupils struggle xxunk xxunk xxmaj xxunk work is marked regularly xxunk xxmaj there are some very good examples of marking that gives pupils clear pointers about how to improve their work but this is not at the same level of quality in all classes xxunk xxmaj there are some opportunities for self xxunk assessment by pupils but these are not always followed up by teachers xxunk xxunk xxmaj the stronger teaching xxunk however xxunk has started to make a positive impact on xxunk progress xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk xxmaj year 5 pupils made good progress in an xxmaj english lesson where they were learning to write and perform poetry because the lesson was well planned to meet the needs of all pupils and so they were all fully engaged and enthusiastic about their work xxunk xxmaj similarly xxunk teaching in a xxmaj year xxunk mathematics lesson where pupils learned about capacity through well planned practical activities xxunk ensured that they made good progress xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching assistants generally make a good contribution to xxunk learning through supporting individuals or small groups to fully participate in lessons xxunk xxmaj they are careful to support while promoting xxunk independence xxunk particularly disabled pupils and those with special educational needs xxunk xxmaj the behaviour and safety of pupils are good xxunk xxmaj behaviour is mostly good in lessons and when pupils are xxunk at playtimes xxunk lunchtimes and in assemblies xxunk xxunk xxmaj older pupils say that teachers manage behaviour well in lessons xxunk xxmaj inspectors agree with this except for a very few occasions where teaching does not fully engage pupils and the behaviour of a few pupils can slip as they become restless and inattentive xxunk which is why behaviour is not outstanding xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school is very inclusive and supports its pupils who find it difficult to manage their own behaviour very well xxunk xxmaj where needed xxunk they receive effective one xxunk to xxunk one support xxunk which minimises any disruption to other pupils in the class xxunk xxunk xxmaj on occasion xxunk staff do not make their expectations clear enough to pupils xxunk for example xxunk how they should line up at the end of playtime and lunchtime xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils have good attitudes to school and are kind and thoughtful towards each other xxunk xxmaj they enjoy the opportunities to work xxunk on tasks xxunk are supportive and helpful and appreciate xxunk successes xxunk xxmaj they enjoy the responsibilities they are given xxunk for example as house captains and buddies xxunk xxunk xxmaj most parents and carers agree that the school keeps their children safe and that they are well looked after xxunk xxmaj they are not so confident that their children behave well although the inspectors found that they do xxunk xxmaj scrutiny of behaviour records show this is the case over time too xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils say they feel very safe in school and understand how to keep safe in different situations xxunk xxmaj in discussion pupils say there is very little bullying in school and that they are confident that if any incidents occur xxunk teachers sort things out quickly and xxunk xxunk xxmaj they have a good awareness that bullying can take different forms such as name calling and physical xxunk prejudiced xxunk based and cyber bullying xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils enjoy coming to school as shown by their

senior leaders are regular and more focused than previously on the quality of xxunk learning xxunk xxmaj where weaknesses are identified xxunk feedback is given to individuals and support is provided xxunk xxmaj however xxunk weaknesses are not always eradicated at a fast enough pace xxunk xxmaj the school recognises that more work needs to be done to ensure that learning and progress are

xxunk understanding of its own effectiveness is accurate in some areas but a little too optimistic in xxunk xxunk xxmaj however xxunk there is a shared drive from a united team of staff to secure

improve teaching so that it is consistently good or better by ensuring that xxunk there are more lessons that provide pupils with active xxunk practical tasks using a broader range of resources and more opportunities for pupils to take risks with their learning assessment information is used more effectively to plan tasks that are more precisely matched to the needs of learners of all abilities

not consistently make good progress from their starting points xxunk xxunk xxmaj children start at the school in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage with skills and knowledge that

xxunk xxmaj compared to the national picture xxunk overall attainment in xxunk was considerably below average for pupils at the end of xxmaj year xxunk xxunk and significantly so in writing as pupils do not build rapidly enough on the gains they make in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has successfully improved the progress pupils make in xxmaj year xxunk to xxmaj year 6 and as a result xxunk attainment at the end of xxmaj year 6 in xxunk was closer to average overall but lower in xxmaj english than in mathematics xxunk xxmaj fewer pupils than found nationally reach the higher xxmaj level xxunk at the end of xxmaj year xxunk or xxmaj level 5 at the end of xxmaj year 6 xxunk xxmaj the provision for disabled pupils and those with special educational needs ensures that they make similar progress to xxunk xxunk xxunk xxmaj in the xxunk tests xxunk the attainment of xxmaj year 6 pupils who benefited from the pupil premium was similar to that of other xxmaj year 6 pupils in the school and pupils nationally in xxmaj english xxunk xxmaj in mathematics their attainment was four months behind xxunk in the school but better than found nationally xxunk xxunk xxmaj in xxmaj english xxunk progress in writing has improved in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk because of the introduction of xxunk the writing xxunk which gives pupils more opportunities to write extended pieces of work xxunk develop spelling xxunk punctuation and grammar skills and write more extensively in different subjects xxunk xxmaj this approach has more recently been introduced in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk and has yet to have a similar impact on progress or attainment xxunk xxunk xxmaj in the xxunk xxmaj year xxunk phonics screening check xxunk linking sounds and letters xxunk taken by

xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage and xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk to include e books xxunk which motivate pupils at school and home xxunk xxmaj pupils have reasonable basic phonic skills to read unfamiliar words but some xxunk particularly less able readers xxunk are not reading confidently to make the text make sense xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has worked hard to promote reading for enjoyment across the school xxunk xxmaj older pupils can talk enthusiastically about favourite authors and express preferences for different types of books xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able readers are encouraged through various lunchtime book clubs and develop higher level reading skills such as inference and deduction to help with their comprehension skills xxunk xxunk xxmaj mathematics lessons start with a mental mathematics session to develop xxunk recall of number facts but these are sometimes too lengthy and not pitched at a fast enough pace to improve xxunk skills xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able pupils in xxmaj year 5 and xxmaj year 6 are often taught in a different group xxunk which is helping xxunk to make faster progress at an appropriate level xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj teaching xxunk improvement because the quality of teaching across the school is inconsistent and varies from good to inadequate xxunk xxmaj there is not yet enough good or better teaching to result in xxunk good achievement xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always have high enough expectations of what pupils can achieve xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching does not always make the best use of a range of resources to encourage pupils to be active in their learning or take risks by finding things out for xxunk xxunk xxmaj the pace of learning is not always fast enough especially when pupils have to listen for too long to xxunk xxmaj inspection report xxunk xxmaj victoria xxmaj road xxmaj primary xxmaj school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 5 of xxunk introductions before starting on their own work xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always use assessment information effectively and so the tasks set in lessons are not always matched precisely to the needs of pupils of different abilities xxunk xxmaj this means that sometimes there are not enough demands made on more xxunk able pupils and sometimes less able pupils struggle xxunk xxunk xxmaj xxunk work is marked regularly xxunk xxmaj there are some very good examples of marking that gives pupils clear pointers about how to improve their work but this is not at the same level of quality in all classes xxunk xxmaj there are some opportunities for self xxunk assessment by pupils but these are not always followed up by teachers xxunk xxunk xxmaj the stronger teaching xxunk however xxunk has started to make a positive impact on xxunk progress xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk xxmaj year 5 pupils made good progress in an xxmaj english lesson where they were learning to write and perform poetry because the lesson was well planned to meet the needs of all pupils and so they were all fully engaged and enthusiastic about their work xxunk xxmaj similarly xxunk teaching in a xxmaj year xxunk mathematics lesson where pupils learned about capacity through well planned practical activities xxunk ensured that they made good progress xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching assistants generally make a good contribution to xxunk learning through supporting individuals or small groups to fully participate in lessons xxunk xxmaj they are careful to support while promoting xxunk independence xxunk particularly disabled pupils and those with special educational needs xxunk xxmaj the behaviour and safety of pupils are good xxunk xxmaj behaviour is mostly good in lessons and when pupils are xxunk at playtimes xxunk lunchtimes and in assemblies xxunk xxunk xxmaj older pupils say that teachers manage behaviour well in lessons xxunk xxmaj inspectors agree with this except for a very few occasions where teaching does not fully engage pupils and the behaviour of a few pupils can slip as they become restless and inattentive xxunk which is why behaviour is not outstanding xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school is very inclusive and supports its pupils who find it difficult to manage their own behaviour very well xxunk xxmaj where needed xxunk they receive effective one xxunk to xxunk one support xxunk which minimises any disruption to other pupils in the class xxunk xxunk xxmaj on occasion xxunk staff do not make their expectations clear enough to pupils xxunk for example xxunk how they should line up at the end of playtime and lunchtime xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils have good attitudes to school and are kind and thoughtful towards each other xxunk xxmaj they enjoy the opportunities to work xxunk on tasks xxunk are supportive and helpful and appreciate xxunk successes xxunk xxmaj they enjoy the responsibilities they are given xxunk for example as house captains and buddies xxunk xxunk xxmaj most parents and carers agree that the school keeps their children safe and that they are well looked after xxunk xxmaj they are not so confident that their children behave well although the inspectors found that they do xxunk xxmaj scrutiny of behaviour records show this is the case over time too xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils say they feel very safe in school and understand how to keep safe in different situations xxunk xxmaj in discussion pupils say there is very little bullying in school and that they are confident that if any incidents occur xxunk teachers sort things out quickly and xxunk xxunk xxmaj they have a good awareness that bullying can take different forms such as name calling and physical xxunk prejudiced xxunk based and cyber bullying xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils enjoy coming to school as shown by their

impeded the pace and full impact of the school xxunk work to raise achievement and improve teaching xxunk xxmaj however xxunk some improved teaching has resulted in better progress for the current

senior leaders are regular and more focused than previously on the quality of xxunk learning xxunk xxmaj where weaknesses are identified xxunk feedback is given to individuals and support is provided xxunk xxmaj however xxunk weaknesses are not always eradicated at a fast enough pace xxunk xxmaj the school recognises that more work needs to be done to ensure that learning and progress are consistently good or better to improve achievement xxunk xxunk xxmaj strong leadership in xxmaj english has helped to successfully secure broadly average standards by the end of xxmaj year 6 and most notably xxunk the better progress in writing xxunk which was an issue to improve in the previous inspection xxunk xxunk xxmaj xxunk progress is tracked efficiently xxunk xxmaj targets are set for teachers that are linked well with the progress pupils make and teachers know they are accountable for xxunk progress and that this is linked to pay and salary progression xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school xxunk understanding of its own effectiveness is accurate in some areas but a little too optimistic in xxunk xxunk xxmaj however xxunk there is a shared drive from a united team of staff to secure school improvement and staff express confidence in and share the ambition of the headteacher xxunk xxmaj action taken as a result of monitoring and evaluation does not always result in rapid enough

xxunk xxmaj improve teaching so that it is consistently good or better by ensuring that xxunk there are more lessons that provide pupils with active xxunk practical tasks using a broader range of resources and more opportunities for pupils to take risks with their learning assessment information is used more effectively to plan tasks that are more precisely matched to the needs of learners of all abilities so that there are greater demands made to challenge pupils and more support for those who find learning harder teachers have consistently high expectations of what pupils can achieve and there is a faster pace to teaching and learning xxunk xxunk xxmaj raise achievement across the school by xxunk sustaining the improving progress being made by the current year groups in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk building more rapidly on the gains made in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year throughout xxmaj years xxunk and xxunk ensuring school plans show how pupils will use and apply their

xxunk 4 of xxunk xxmaj inspection judgements xxmaj the achievement of pupils xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj achievement xxunk improvement because progress is uneven across the school xxunk xxmaj consequently pupils do not consistently make good progress from their starting points xxunk xxunk xxmaj children start at the school in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage with skills and knowledge that vary from year to year and are often below expectations for their age but are currently as expected for their age xxunk xxmaj children make expected progress in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj compared to the national picture xxunk overall attainment in xxunk was considerably below average for pupils at the end of xxmaj year xxunk xxunk and significantly so in writing as pupils do not build rapidly enough on the gains they make in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has successfully improved the progress pupils make in xxmaj year xxunk to xxmaj year 6 and as a result xxunk attainment at the end of xxmaj year 6 in xxunk was closer to average overall but lower in xxmaj english than in mathematics xxunk xxmaj fewer pupils than found nationally reach the higher xxmaj level xxunk at the end of xxmaj year xxunk or xxmaj level 5 at the end of xxmaj year 6 xxunk xxmaj the provision for disabled pupils and those with special educational needs ensures that they make similar progress to xxunk xxunk xxunk xxmaj in the xxunk tests xxunk the attainment of xxmaj year 6 pupils who benefited from the pupil premium was similar to that of other xxmaj year 6 pupils in the school and pupils nationally in xxmaj english xxunk xxmaj in mathematics their attainment was four months behind xxunk in the school but better than found nationally xxunk xxunk xxmaj in xxmaj english xxunk progress in writing has improved in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk because of the introduction of xxunk the writing journey xxunk which gives pupils more opportunities to write extended pieces of work xxunk develop spelling xxunk punctuation and grammar skills and write more extensively in different subjects xxunk xxmaj this approach has more recently been introduced in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk and has yet to have a similar impact on progress or attainment xxunk xxunk xxmaj in the xxunk xxmaj year xxunk phonics screening check xxunk linking sounds and letters xxunk taken by pupils currently in xxmaj year xxunk xxunk the proportion of pupils achieving the expected result was below average xxunk xxmaj the school has extended phonics teaching in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage and xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk to include e books xxunk which motivate pupils at school and home xxunk xxmaj pupils have reasonable basic phonic skills to read unfamiliar words but some xxunk particularly less able readers xxunk are not reading confidently to make the text make sense xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has worked hard to promote reading for enjoyment across the school xxunk xxmaj older pupils can talk enthusiastically about favourite authors and express preferences for different types of books xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able readers are encouraged through various lunchtime book clubs and develop higher level reading skills such as inference and deduction to help with their comprehension skills xxunk xxunk xxmaj mathematics lessons start with a mental mathematics session to develop pupils xxunk recall of number facts but these are sometimes too lengthy and not pitched at a fast enough pace to improve pupils xxunk skills xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able pupils in xxmaj year 5 and xxmaj year 6 are often taught in a different group xxunk which is helping xxunk to make faster progress at an appropriate level xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj teaching xxunk improvement because the quality of teaching across the school is inconsistent and varies from good to inadequate xxunk xxmaj there is not yet enough good or better teaching to result in pupils xxunk good achievement xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always have high enough expectations of what pupils can achieve xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching does not always make the best use of a range of resources to encourage pupils to be active in their learning or take risks by finding things out for xxunk xxunk xxmaj the pace of learning is not always fast enough especially when pupils have to listen for too long to teachers xxunk xxmaj inspection report xxunk xxmaj victoria xxmaj road xxmaj primary xxmaj school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 5 of xxunk introductions before starting on their own work xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always use assessment information effectively and so the tasks set in lessons are not always matched precisely to the needs of pupils of different abilities xxunk xxmaj this means that sometimes there are not enough demands made on more xxunk able pupils and sometimes less able pupils struggle xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils xxunk work is marked regularly xxunk xxmaj there are some very good examples of marking that gives pupils clear pointers about how to improve their work but this is not at the same level of quality in all classes xxunk xxmaj there are some opportunities for self xxunk assessment by pupils but these are not always followed up by teachers xxunk xxunk xxmaj the stronger teaching xxunk however xxunk has started to make a positive impact on pupils xxunk progress xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk xxmaj year 5 pupils made good progress in an xxmaj english lesson where they were learning to write and perform poetry because the lesson was well planned to meet the needs of all pupils and so they were all fully engaged and enthusiastic about their work xxunk xxmaj similarly xxunk teaching in a xxmaj year xxunk mathematics lesson where pupils learned about capacity through well planned practical activities xxunk ensured that they made good progress xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching assistants generally make a good contribution to pupils xxunk learning through supporting individuals or small groups to fully participate in lessons xxunk xxmaj they are careful to support while promoting pupils xxunk independence xxunk particularly disabled pupils and those with special educational needs xxunk xxmaj the behaviour and safety of pupils are good xxunk xxmaj behaviour is mostly good in lessons and when pupils are xxunk at playtimes xxunk lunchtimes and in assemblies xxunk xxunk xxmaj older pupils say that teachers manage behaviour well in lessons xxunk xxmaj inspectors agree with this except for a very few occasions where teaching does not fully engage pupils and the behaviour of a few pupils can slip as they become restless and inattentive xxunk which is why behaviour is not outstanding xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school is very inclusive and supports its pupils who find it difficult to manage their own behaviour very well xxunk

    "## Checking the Precision of Our Model\n",
    "As we said before, our dataset is imbalanced, so accuracy is not a good measure of our model's effectiveness. Precision refers to how close predictions from different samples are to each other. Below, we use `average_precision_score` from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html). A single precision score is evaluated as `tp / (tp + fp)` where `tp` stands for *true positives* and `fp` stands for *false positives*. Average precision summarizes a precision-recall curve as the weighted mean of precisions achieved at each threshold. The increase in recall from the previous threshold is used as a weight. Recall measures the model's ability to find all relevant results that are correctly classified by your algorithm. Recall is the ratio `tp / (tp + fn)` where `tp` stands for *true positives* and `fn` stands for *false negatives*."

xxunk xxmaj improve teaching so that it is consistently good or better by ensuring that xxunk there are more lessons that provide pupils with active xxunk practical tasks using a broader range of

significantly so in writing as pupils do not build rapidly enough on the gains they make in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has successfully improved the progress pupils make in xxmaj year xxunk to xxmaj year 6 and as a result xxunk attainment at the end of xxmaj year 6 in xxunk was closer to average overall but lower in xxmaj english than in mathematics xxunk xxmaj fewer pupils than found nationally reach the higher xxmaj level xxunk at the end of xxmaj year xxunk or xxmaj level 5 at the end of xxmaj year 6 xxunk xxmaj the provision for disabled pupils and those

was similar to that of other xxmaj year 6 pupils in the school and pupils nationally in xxmaj english xxunk xxmaj in mathematics their attainment was four months behind xxunk in the school but better than found nationally xxunk xxunk xxmaj in xxmaj english xxunk progress in writing has improved in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk because of the introduction of xxunk the writing journey xxunk which

xxunk linking sounds and letters xxunk taken by pupils currently in xxmaj year xxunk xxunk the proportion of pupils achieving the expected result was below average xxunk xxmaj the school has extended phonics teaching in the xxmaj early xxmaj years xxmaj foundation xxmaj stage and xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk to include e books xxunk which motivate pupils at school and home xxunk xxmaj pupils have reasonable basic phonic skills to read unfamiliar words but some xxunk particularly less able readers xxunk are not reading confidently to make the text make sense xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has worked hard to promote reading for enjoyment across the school xxunk xxmaj older pupils can talk enthusiastically about favourite authors and express preferences for different types of books xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able readers are encouraged through various lunchtime book clubs and develop higher level reading skills such as inference and deduction to help with their comprehension skills xxunk xxunk xxmaj mathematics lessons start with a mental mathematics session to develop pupils xxunk recall of number facts but these are sometimes too lengthy and not pitched at a fast enough pace to improve pupils xxunk skills xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able pupils in xxmaj year 5 and xxmaj year 6 are often taught in a different group xxunk which is helping xxunk to make faster progress at an appropriate level xxunk xxmaj the quality of teaching xxunk improvement xxunk xxmaj teaching xxunk improvement because the quality of teaching across the school is inconsistent and varies from good to

school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 5 of xxunk introductions before starting on their own work xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always use assessment information effectively and so the tasks set in

less able pupils struggle xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils xxunk work is marked regularly xxunk xxmaj there are some very good examples of marking that gives pupils clear pointers about how to improve their work but this is not at the same level of quality in all classes xxunk xxmaj there are some opportunities for self xxunk assessment by pupils but these are not always followed up by teachers xxunk xxunk xxmaj the stronger teaching xxunk however xxunk has started to make a positive impact on pupils xxunk progress xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk xxmaj year 5 pupils made good progress in an xxmaj english lesson where they were learning to write and perform poetry because the lesson was well planned to meet the needs of all pupils and so they were all fully engaged and enthusiastic about their work xxunk xxmaj similarly xxunk teaching in a xxmaj year xxunk mathematics lesson where pupils learned about capacity through well planned practical activities xxunk ensured that they made good progress xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching assistants generally make a good contribution to pupils xxunk learning through supporting individuals or small groups to fully participate in lessons xxunk xxmaj they are careful to support while promoting pupils xxunk independence xxunk particularly disabled pupils and those with special educational needs xxunk xxmaj the behaviour and safety of pupils are good xxunk xxmaj behaviour is mostly good in lessons and when pupils are xxunk at playtimes xxunk lunchtimes and in assemblies xxunk xxunk xxmaj older pupils say that teachers manage behaviour well in lessons xxunk xxmaj inspectors agree with this except for a very few occasions where teaching does not fully engage pupils and the behaviour of a few pupils can slip as they become restless and inattentive xxunk which is why behaviour is not outstanding xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school is very inclusive and supports its pupils who find it difficult to manage their own behaviour very well xxunk xxmaj where needed xxunk they receive effective one xxunk to xxunk one support xxunk which minimises any disruption to other pupils in the class xxunk xxunk xxmaj on occasion xxunk staff do not make their expectations clear enough to pupils xxunk for example xxunk how they should line up at the end of playtime and lunchtime xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils have good attitudes to school and are kind and

after xxunk xxmaj they are not so confident that their children behave well although the inspectors found that they do xxunk xxmaj scrutiny of behaviour records show this is the case over time too xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils say they feel very safe in school and understand how to keep safe in different situations xxunk xxmaj in discussion pupils say there is very little bullying in school and that they are confident that if any incidents occur xxunk teachers sort things out quickly and xxunk xxunk xxmaj they have a good awareness that bullying can take different forms such as name calling and

xxunk xxmaj improve teaching so that it is consistently good or better by ensuring that xxunk there are more lessons that provide pupils with active xxunk practical tasks using a broader range of resources and more opportunities for pupils to take risks with their learning assessment information is used more effectively to plan tasks that are more precisely matched to the needs of learners of

reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj compared to the national picture xxunk overall attainment in xxunk was considerably below average for pupils at the end of xxmaj year xxunk xxunk and significantly so in writing as pupils do not build rapidly enough on the gains they make in the xxmaj reception xxmaj year xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has successfully improved the progress pupils make in xxmaj year xxunk to xxmaj year 6 and as a result xxunk attainment at the end of xxmaj year 6 in xxunk was closer to average overall but lower in xxmaj english than in mathematics xxunk xxmaj fewer pupils than found nationally reach the higher xxmaj level xxunk at the end of xxmaj year xxunk or xxmaj level 5 at the end of xxmaj year 6 xxunk xxmaj the provision for disabled pupils and those

than found nationally xxunk xxunk xxmaj in xxmaj english xxunk progress in writing has improved in xxmaj key xxmaj stage xxunk because of the introduction of xxunk the writing journey xxunk which

reasonable basic phonic skills to read unfamiliar words but some xxunk particularly less able readers xxunk are not reading confidently to make the text make sense xxunk xxunk xxmaj the school has worked hard to promote reading for enjoyment across the school xxunk xxmaj older pupils can talk enthusiastically about favourite authors and express preferences for different types of books xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able readers are encouraged through various lunchtime book clubs and develop higher level reading skills such as inference and deduction to help with their comprehension skills xxunk xxunk xxmaj mathematics lessons start with a mental mathematics session to develop pupils xxunk recall of number facts but these are sometimes too lengthy and not pitched at a fast enough pace to improve pupils xxunk skills xxunk xxmaj more xxunk able pupils in xxmaj year 5 and xxmaj year 6 are often taught in a different group xxunk which is helping xxunk to make faster progress at an

school xxunk xxunk xxmaj june xxunk 5 of xxunk introductions before starting on their own work xxunk xxunk xxmaj teachers do not always use assessment information effectively and so the tasks set in

xxunk xxmaj the stronger teaching xxunk however xxunk has started to make a positive impact on pupils xxunk progress xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk xxmaj year 5 pupils made good progress in an xxmaj english lesson where they were learning to write and perform poetry because the lesson was well planned to meet the needs of all pupils and so they were all fully engaged and enthusiastic about their work xxunk xxmaj similarly xxunk teaching in a xxmaj year xxunk mathematics lesson where pupils learned about capacity through well planned practical activities xxunk ensured that they made good progress xxunk xxunk xxmaj teaching assistants generally make a good contribution to pupils xxunk learning through supporting individuals or small groups to fully participate in lessons xxunk xxmaj they are careful to support while promoting pupils xxunk independence xxunk particularly disabled pupils and those with special educational needs xxunk xxmaj the behaviour and safety of pupils are good xxunk xxmaj behaviour is mostly good in lessons and when pupils are xxunk at playtimes xxunk lunchtimes and in assemblies xxunk xxunk xxmaj older pupils say that teachers manage behaviour well in lessons xxunk xxmaj inspectors agree with this except for a very few occasions where teaching does not fully engage pupils and the behaviour of a few pupils can slip as they become restless and

xxmaj where needed xxunk they receive effective one xxunk to xxunk one support xxunk which minimises any disruption to other pupils in the class xxunk xxunk xxmaj on occasion xxunk staff do not make

xxunk xxunk xxmaj pupils say they feel very safe in school and understand how to keep safe in different situations xxunk xxmaj in discussion pupils say there is very little bullying in school and that they are confident that if any incidents occur xxunk teachers sort things out quickly and xxunk xxunk xxmaj they have a good awareness that bullying can take different forms such as name calling and
