    "# Predicting School Closures Based on Inspection Reports with Deep Learning\n",
    "We scraped school inspection reports from [Ofsted](https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk) in an attempt to predict whether or not a school is in danger of closing. In this notebook, we take a deep learning approach to a Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem. This notebook applies [fast.ai's transfer learning](https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/) approach by training a language model (we'll get into what that is soon) on a large corpus of school reports. This model is then used to help our classifier predict whether or not a report contains some indication that the school will close.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic behind our approach was to separate all of the final reports of schools that have already closed. The idea behind this was that these reports may contain some information as to why the school would close. We labeled these reports `last`, while all other reports were labeled `not_last`."

    "## About the Dataset\n",
    "We filtered out some of the reports we scraped that had certain characteristics that we thought were not relevant to the problem we were trying to solve. Here are some of the reports we didn't include in our dataset: \n",
    "- Childminders: daycares in an individual's home who can care for up to six children at a time, including their own. Childminders are not necessarily academic institutions, so we have filtered them out.\n",
    "- Academy Converter Predecessors: under the [Academies Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academies_Act_2010), schools had the option to become academies, which gave them more independence from the control of local authority. Since these schools technically did not close, but may have changed their names, we have not included them in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is important to note that [Ofsted does not continue to inspect schools once they are known for being Outstanding](https://www.bbc.com/news/education-48635078). Our data does not account for whether an Outstanding school has deteriorated in quality after its last inspection."

are already exerting greater influence on quality of teaching across academy xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk middle leaders are xxunk paing xxunk teachers to develop practice in marking and giving feedback to students xxunk xxmaj students say that this is helping m to make better progress because it tells m exactly what y need to do to improve work xxunk xxmaj although academy xxunk improvement

xxunk xxunk i write on behalf of xxmaj her xxmaj majesty xxunk xxmaj chief xxmaj inspector of xxmaj education xxunk xxmaj children xxunk xxmaj services and xxmaj skills to report findings xxunk xxmaj thank you for help you gave me and for time you made available to discuss actions you are taking to improve academy since most recent section 5 xxunk xxmaj the visit was fst monitoring since academy

findings xxmaj senior leaders fully accept that xxmaj de xxmaj xxunk xxmaj academy reques improvement and recognise that urgent action is needed to get academy to xxunk xxmaj there is a shared and determined drive for improvement and a strong commitment to tackle weaknesses identified at last section 5 xxunk xxmaj systems to support improvement have been strengned xxunk xxmaj senior leaders are routinely checking xxunk work xxunk for example xxunk by observing xxunk in lessons xxunk scrutinising work in books and monitoring progress towards targets xxunk xxmaj however xxunk this work is not always precise enough to pin xxunk point exactly where improvement is needed and areas for improvement are not always tackled with necessary urgency xxunk xxmaj middle leaders have a stronger role and are already exerting greater influence on quality of teaching across academy xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk middle leaders are xxunk paing xxunk teachers to develop practice in marking and giving feedback to students xxunk xxmaj students say that this is helping m to make better progress because it tells m exactly what y need to do to improve work xxunk xxmaj although academy xxunk improvement plan is closely linked to areas for improvement identified at last section 5 xxunk it does not include measurable step xxunk by xxunk step targets or clearly specify how and when progress towards se targets will be monitored and reviewed xxunk xxmaj for example xxunk improving attendance and reducing persistent absence are identified as priorities xxunk but plan does not specify by how much or by when xxunk ne does it identify groups of students whose attendance needs to improve most quickly xxunk xxmaj governors are ambitious for academy and have already taken steps to ensure that y are better informed xxunk xxmaj to furr strengn role xxunk ernors need to demand better and more precise information about implementation and impact of academy xxunk improvement plan so that y can keep a closer eye on wher improvement is swift enough xxunk xxmaj senior leaders and ernors are taking effective action to tackle areas requing improvement identified at recent section 5 xxunk xxmaj the academy should take furr action to xxunk xxunk xxmaj strengn academy improvement plan so that it clearly identifies measurable step xxunk by xxunk step targets for improvement and specifies how and when progress towards se targets will be monitored and reviewed xxunk may carry out furr monitoring s and xxunk where necessary xxunk provide furr support and challenge to academy until its next section 5 xxunk xxmaj external support xxmaj the academy is building a network of support xxunk drawing on practice in outstanding and academies across region xxunk xxmaj there is a stronger role for academy sponsor in checking progress and impact of academy xxunk actions and providing more detailed evaluative information and greater challenge for senior leaders and ernors xxunk xxmaj greater
