The registered person must ensure that this provision complies with the statutory framework for children’s learning, development and welfare, known as the s Foundation Stage.  The provider must provide a copy of this report to all parents with children at the setting where reasonably practicable.  The provider must provide a copy of the report to any other person who asks for one, but may charge a fee for this service (The Childcare (Inspection) Regulations 2008 regulations 9 and 10).  The setting also makes provision for children older than the s age group which is registered on the voluntary and/or compulsory part(s) of the Childcare Register. This report does not include an evaluation of that provision, but a comment about compliance with the requirements of the Childcare Register is included in Annex B.  :  02/07/2009    3 This inspection was carried out under sections 49 and 50 of the Childcare Act 2006   Description of the childminding  The childminder has been registered since in 2009. She lives with her husband, her sister-in-law, her nephew who is aged six and her own children who are aged one and six. The childminder's husband works as an assistant. The family live in the Whalley Range district of Manchester, close to shops, parks, schools and public transport links. The whole of the ground floor and the bathroom on the first floor are used for childminding. Children participate in physical and outdoor play activities at the local park and in the enclosed rear yard. The childminder is registered to care for a maximum of four children under eight years at any one time when she is working alone, of whom no more than two may be in the s age range. She is currently minding two children in this age group. When working with her husband she is registered to care for a maximum of six children under eight years at any one time, of whom no more than four may be in the s age range. She also offers care to children aged over five years to 11 years. This provision is registered by Ofsted on the compulsory and voluntary parts of the Childcare Register. The childminder is a member of the National Childminding Association.   Overall effectiveness of the s provision  Overall the quality of the provision is good. The childminder uses her good knowledge of individual children, their interests and abilities to successfully promote their welfare and learning. Children are making good progress in their learning and development given their starting points and capabilities. Self-evaluation is at an early stage and does not clearly identify areas for improvement. Every child is valued for their individuality and mostly positive steps are taken to help them to find out about equality and diversity. Positive partnerships with parents are enabling the childminder to effectively respond to and meet children's individual needs.  What steps need to be taken to improve provision further?   To further improve the s provision the registered person should:    further develop systems to evaluate practice and use to continually look for ways to improve the quality of the learning, development and care that is offered, for example, by finding ways to involve parents and children in self assessment    ensure there is continuity and coherence in the education and care of children who attend more than one setting by sharing relevant information with each other    help children learn they have similarities and differences that connect them to, and distinguish them from, others by increasing the range of resources and activities that portray positive images of culture, gender and disability.     :  02/07/2009    4 This inspection was carried out under sections 49 and 50 of the Childcare Act 2006   The leadership and management of the s provision  The childminder is just beginning to devise ways to evaluate her practice and identify areas for continuous improvement, and parents and children are not sufficiently well involved in self evaluation. The childminder has a commitment to developing her skills and knowledge through attendance on relevant training courses, such as An Introduction to the s Foundation Stage (EYFS). She has used this training well to develop systems to observe, asses and plan for children.  A positive partnership has been fostered with parents. The childminder works very closely with parents to share useful and important information about children. Discussions, a childminding journal, observations and children’s scrapbooks keep parents well informed about their child and the progress they are making in their learning. Links with other EYFS groups are not quite as well developed to ensure there is coherence in the children’s learning and development between settings.   Children are safeguarded because the childminder has a good understanding of safeguarding issues and what she must do if she has concerns about a child’s wellbeing. She diligently supervises children at all times, has conducted risk assessments and put effective safety precautions in place to minimise identified hazards. Policies and procedures have been formalised to underpin the childminder practice to ensure continuity of care for the children.  The quality and standards of the s provision   Children are settled, content and happy in the childminder’s care, where they eagerly play with the toys and activities. The childminder has formalised good systems to observe, assess, and plan for individual children’s learning and development. Planning for children’s next steps is used very well to identify interesting activities and resources that capture the children’s interest and help them make good progress in their learning. Children participate in a balanced range of adult and child led activities across the six areas of learning. They are starting to become increasingly independent as they confidently explore the environment and select what to play with from the easily accessible toys and activities. Educational posters are displayed on the walls to help make the home stimulating and child friendly.   Children have access to a good range of books, including dual language books which positively reinforce their home language and help them to learn English. Children show an awareness and keen interest in problem solving and reasoning activities. They match coloured pegs to make pictures of butterflies, count coloured discs on the shape sorter and explore activity centres to find out how they work. Children enjoy designing and building using a variety of construction sets. Their physical development is well promoted through a variety of fun activities indoors and outdoors. Children enjoy the fresh air and the outside environment when they visit the park, where playing football and the slide and swings are most popular. Children participate in a good variety of activities which promote their creativity, :  02/07/2009    5 This inspection was carried out under sections 49 and 50 of the Childcare Act 2006   such as singing, dancing, dressing up, painting and sticking. They put lots of paint and glitter on their paper to make colourful pictures. Children love to dress up as princesses and happily take dolls for walks in pushchairs and make them snacks in the toy microwave.   Children benefit from the positive steps the childminder takes to acknowledge, respect and value them as individuals. They have access to books that provide positive images of gender, culture and disability. However, children do not have sufficient opportunities to explore a wide range of resources and activities designed to help them learn to value different aspects of their own and other people’s lives. Children are learning how to keep themselves safe and healthy through routines, good practice, activities and discussions. For example, they discuss crossing the road safely on outings and always cross at a designated crossing. They talk about the benefits of healthy eating and posters are displayed to remind them which foods are healthy. Children eat a varied and nutritious diet that includes lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. :  02/07/2009    6 This inspection was carried out under sections 49 and 50 of the Childcare Act 2006   Annex A: record of inspection judgements  The key inspection judgements and what they mean   Grade 1 is Outstanding: this aspect of the provision is of exceptionally high quality  Grade 2 is Good: this aspect of the provision is strong  Grade 3 is Satisfactory: this aspect of the provision is sound  Grade 4 is Inadequate: this aspect of the provision is not good enough   Overall effectiveness  How effective is the provision in meeting the needs of children in the s Foundation Stage? 2 How well does the provision promote inclusive practice? 2 The capacity of the provision to maintain continuous improvement. 3  Leadership and management  How effectively is provision in the s Foundation Stage led and managed? 2 How effective is the setting’s self-evaluation, including the steps taken to promote improvement? 3 How well does the setting work in partnership with parents and others? 2 How well are children safeguarded? 2  Quality and standards   How effectively are children in the s Foundation Stage helped to learn and develop? 2 How effectively is the welfare of children in the s Foundation Stage promoted? 2 How well are children helped to stay safe?  2 How well are children helped to be healthy? 2 How well are children helped to enjoy and achieve? 2 How well are children helped to make a positive contribution? 3 How well are children helped develop skills that will contribute to their future economic well-being? 2  Any complaints about the inspection or report should be made following the procedures set out in the guidance available from Ofsted’s website:  :  02/07/2009    7 This inspection was carried out under sections 49 and 50 of the Childcare Act 2006   Annex B: the Childcare Register    The provider confirms that the requirements of the compulsory part of the Childcare Register are:  Met    The provider confirms that the requirements of the voluntary part of the Childcare Register are:  Met  \""

Inspector  Claire Nunn   : Leo's Den Nursery, 22 February 2017  3 of 5     Inspection findings  Effectiveness of the leadership and management is good    Safeguarding is effective. Staff fully understand the procedures to follow if they have concerns about a child's welfare. There are good recruitment procedures to check and verify the suitability of all staff to work with children. Staff are deployed well. They have a good understanding of policies and procedures, and maintain the required records to help keep children safe at all times. The manager uses self-evaluation effectively to identify areas to improve. For instance, she has developed the outdoor area to support children's sensory and physical skills.      Quality of teaching, learning and assessment is good    Overall, staff are skilled, well qualified and confident in their teaching. In general, staff have a good understanding of children's abilities and identify ways to encourage their further development. Staff encourage babies to explore their environment and the resources around them. For example, babies show delight as they develop their physical skills by rolling and chasing coloured balls. Children's early literacy skills develop well. They learn the sounds initial letters represent and practise the shapes needed in writing. Overall, staff support children's communication and language well. For example, children eagerly sing rhymes they know well. The manager has a good overview of children's learning. Staff monitor children's progress well and identify any gaps. For example, additional support is gained quickly to help children who have special educational needs and/or disabilities make good progress.    Personal development, behaviour and welfare are good    Children are extremely settled at the nursery. Staff are highly attentive to their needs. Staff have very nurturing and close relationships with children and babies who, for example, enjoy snuggling and having individual time with staff. Children have a good awareness of healthy lifestyles, such as knowing the positive effect that exercise has on their body. Children behave well. For instance, they are highly responsive to staff and listen extremely well. Children value their friendships; they actively seek out others to share their excitement and enthusiasm. The manager and staff regularly carry out safety risk assessments to check the suitability of the environment and equipment. This helps to ensure that potential hazards to children are minimised.     Outcomes for children are good   Children are motivated and enthusiastic to learn. All children make good progress, given what they know when they start. They listen carefully, and babies are happy and show interest in the things around them. Children learn early mathematical ideas. For example, they are able to count out how many children go into the garden. Children are prepared well to move on to school.    : Leo's Den Nursery, 22 February 2017  4 of 5       Setting details Unique reference number EY382828 Local authority Southwark Inspection number 1062224 Type of provision Full-time provision Day care type Childcare - Non-Domestic Registers s Register, Compulsory Childcare Register, Voluntary Childcare Register Age range of children 0 - 4 Total number of places 40 Number of children on roll 35 Name of registered person Success Associates Ltd Registered person unique reference number RP528533 Date of previous inspection 11 June 2013 Telephone number 0207 403 4484  Leo's Den Nursery registered in 2012 and is located in the London Borough of Southwark.
